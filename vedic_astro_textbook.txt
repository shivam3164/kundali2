Looking Back: An Update 
In the last ten years since writing this book, my a strology studies and research 
continued and my knowledge has been considerably re fined. I have refined several 
calculations and concepts shared in this book, base d on my studies, insights and 
experimentation. I may try to edit this book or wri te a new book in future, reflecting 
the refinements in knowledge. However, I think that  the book may still be useful for 
clarifying some basic concepts and preparing the gr ound for advanced studies. So I 
am sharing this book freely with all. 
 
Some of my researches are shared as free articles on 
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/articles

Dedication 
 
 
This book is humbly dedicated to the lotus feet of three great men from 
whom I learnt Jyotish: 
 
1.  
Sri P. Venkata Subrahmanyachalapathi 
Rao  
(my father and my first guru), 
2.  Dr. B. V. Raman  (immortal author who 
rendered great yeoman’s service to Jyotish), and, 
3.  Pt. Sanjay Rath  (author, my guru and founder 
of “Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre”). 
 
My only qualification for writing this book, apart from great enthusiasm 
to share my little knowledge with others, is the li ttle knowledge I gained 
from the above three gurus. Whatever flows from my pen (or rather 
computer keyboard) is due to the knowledge and bles sings I received 
from Mahavishnu and the above three great men. This  book really 
belongs to them and not to me 
1.

Preface 
With the Creator said to be one of its eighteen gre at preceptors, Jyotish or Vedic 
astrology is thought to be as old as this creation is. There are many excellent books 
on Jyotish written in Sanskrit language by great Ma harshis and brilliant scholars. 
Thanks to the yeoman service rendered by Dr. B.V. R aman and the efforts of other 
Indian astrologers to follow him, today we have a f air amount of Jyotish literature in 
English language too. 
 
Considering the wealth of Vedic astrology literatur e in Sanskrit and English, another 
book may not really be needed. Even if another book  is needed, there are many 
erudite scholars who are better equipped than me to  write. Nevertheless, I wanted, 
like a parrot that enthusiastically repeats the few  words learnt by it, to share with 
fellow students the little knowledge I received from classics and from my gurus. 
 
In this book, I covered divisional charts, special ascendants, arudhas, argalas, yogas, 
ashtakavarga, avasthas, a few nakshatra dasas, a fe w rasi dasas, several techniques  
of transit analysis, Tajaka analysis and a few miscellaneous topics. 
 
I tried to give prominence to special ascendants, d ivisional charts and arudhas, 
because contemporary literature doesn't seem to giv e them the kind of importance 
that Sage Parasara gave. Understanding the primacy Parasara gave to all these 
concepts is a must for a renaissance in Vedic astrology. 
 
Unfortunately, some people think today that Parasar a and Jaimini taught two totally 
different approaches to astrology. When we talk abo ut arudha padas, argalas, chara 
karakas, chara dasa and other rasi dasas, people th ink of them as “Jaimini astrology”. 
People even use terms like “Jaimini karakas” and “J aimini dasas”. However, all 
these concepts were covered by Parasara also (pleas e read “Brihat Parasara Hora 
Sastram”). The “Parasari vs Jaimini” distinction is  based on unfortunate 
misconceptions that we can do away with. 
 
In this book, I have de-emphasized these wrong dist inctions and emphasized an 
integrated approach – a holistic approach – that looks at Vedi c astrology as a whole. 
I really think that this is the right approach. 
 

--- Page 8 ---
    
 
In the part on dasas, I covered Vimsottari dasa and  Ashtottari dasa, as they are the 
most commonly used nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa  was termed the “most 
respectable dasa” by Parasara and a discussion on d asas cannot be complete without 
it. In the galaxy of dasas, rasi dasas taught by Pa rasara and Jaimini have their own 
place and I covered two rasi dasas used for timing material success – Lagna 
Kendradi Rasi dasa and Sudasa. I also covered Naray ana dasa, which is the most 
versatile rasi dasa taught by maharshis. For the sp iritually inclined, I included 
Drigdasa, which can help us in timing events in one ’s spiritual evolution. Because of 
the importance of the topic of longevity, I covered  two ayur dasas – Shoola dasa and 
Niryaana Shoola Dasa. 
 
In the part on transits, I covered the interpretati on of transits based on the natal 
positions of planets in rasi chart and divisional c harts. I covered some techniques 
based on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas. I also cov ered several techniques related 
to transits in nakshatras. 
 
In the part on Tajaka, I covered the casting of Taj aka annual, monthly and sixty-hour 
charts, their interpretation, Tajaka yogas and thre e dasas used for timing events in 
Tajaka charts. Some scholars may validly question w hy Tajaka system is being 
covered in a book on Vedic astrology. There are no references to it in the works of 
Parasara, Jaimini and other maharshis. The oldest r eference to these techniques to be 
found in the works of a respected authority on Vedi c astrology is in “Tajaka 
Neelakanthi”, a work by Neelakantha who also wrote a celebrated commentary on 
“Jaimini Sutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system len ds some authenticity to the 
system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked about this system in parts 
that are possibly missing today. I simply followed the precedent set by illustrious 
scholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. Raman. 
 
When we rely on finer techniques of Vedic astrology  – such as divisional charts and 
special lagnas – for finer predictions, it is cruci al to have an accurate birthtime. The 
chapter “Impact of Birthtime Error” shows how to cope with birthtime inaccuracies. 
 
While I am upset with the dismissal of astrology by  some critics as a ‘superstition’, I 
am equally, if not more, upset with the irrational and unscientific attitude of some 
astrologers. In an effort to promote rational think ing in the astrological community, I 
included a chapter on “Rational Thinking”. 
 

--- Page 9 ---
 
 
   
 
 
 
A very brief introduction to some special topics such as remedial measures, mundane 
astrology and muhurtas is provided in this book and  it is hoped that interested 
readers will pursue these topics further by referring to other textbooks. 
 
Vedic astrology is considered a sacred subject and Maharshi Parasara warned us 
against sharing this knowledge with unworthy people . Ancient Sages laid down 
some rules for the ethical behavior of a Vedic astr ologer. I earnestly hope that all the 
readers of this book will appreciate those rules. T o that end, I added a chapter on 
“Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi”. 
 
While no particular topic has been covered in great depth, most key fundamentals are 
covered in this book. Most fundamental concepts and  computations are clearly 
defined with examples and their uses are briefly ou tlined. But I do not want to bill 
this as a comprehensive introduction for beginners.  There are parts of this book that 
can be followed even by beginners, but an average b eginner may find it 
overwhelming in many places. For most part, this bo ok is for intermediate level 
students who already have a good background, but ar e in need of integrating and 
consolidating their knowledge. However, there are s ome points in some places that 
can be appreciated only by advanced scholars. So I will not make any claims on who 
will find this book useful. Rather than targeting r eadership with a specific level of 
knowledge, I tried to write a more or less self-sufficient book that covers a wide 
spectrum of topics. Beginners should read this book very car efully, and more than 
once, to completely understand various concepts. Th ough I have tried to maintain 
some level of clarity, I squeezed in a lot of mater ial and beginners should patiently 
read, re-read and practice. 
 
Due to my background in engineering, I tried to ado pt a style somewhat similar to 
the one used in mathematics and physics textbooks. I tried to be concise and always 
to the point. I gave plenty of examples and even so me exercises. I hope that students 
will read the material and examples carefully and a ttempt the exercises sincerely. I 
hope that the astrological community will accept this new style of astrology teaching. 
 
In this book, I did not try to steer clear of the controversies plaguing Vedic astrology. 
As my purpose in writing this book is to chronicle my broad understanding of 
Jyotish in a clear and concise fashion and to give clear guidance to fellow students, I 
stated my views clearly except in issues in which I do not have a firm opinion.

This book probably contains some fine knowledge, du e to the blessings I received 
from my gurus, and some wrong knowledge as well, du e to the limitations of my 
intelligence. Giving fine knowledge to unworthy stu dents and feeding wrong 
knowledge to worthy students are both mistakes and I am aware that I may be 
committing both. I beg for the forgiveness of my gurus, maharshis and gods. 
 
A free computer software program written by me call ed “Jagannatha Hora” is 
available for a free  download on my website ( 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org ). It 
can compute the positions of all planets, upagrahas , lagna, special lagnas, arudha 
padas and ashtakavarga for twenty divisional charts . It supports several popular 
ayanamsas. It gives Shadbalas, Vimsottari, Ashtotta ri and Kalachakra dasas and also 
gives Tajaka annual charts, Patyayini dasa, Mudda d asa, Panchavargeeya Bala and 
Sahams. Those who have a computer with a Microsoft operating system (Windows 
95 or later) can download and use this software. 
 
As I dedicated most of my free time in the last few  years to astrology reading, 
research and writing, my wife Padmaja, my daughter Sriharini and my son Sriharish 
made a personal sacrifice and co-operated with my a strological activities. I am 
thankful to them for their co-operation. 
 
I cannot possibly finish this preface without expre ssing my deep gratitude for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant sourc e of enlightenment, 
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grate ful to him. I express my gratitude 
to all the elders and well-wishers whose blessings gave me the energy to finish this 
book. I hope that I will be forgiven for any mistak es and that I will continue to 
receive their kind blessings. 
 
 
May Jupiter’s light shine on us,

Part 1:  Chart Analysis 
 
 
 
Several important principles and techniques of char t analysis 
are explained in this part. This part forms the bas is for the rest 
of the book. 
 
Based on the positions of all the planets when a pe rson is born, 
several charts are prepared. They go by the names –  “rasi chart” 
and “divisional charts”. Based on the analysis of t hese charts, 
several conclusions can be drawn regarding the resu lts that can 
be given by different planets to the native. This p art covers the 
analysis and judgment of these charts. 
 
It can help if the reader has basic understanding a nd prior 
knowledge of Vedic or western astrology, but it is not really 
required. This part is intended to be self-sufficie nt. However, 
bear in mind that extra reading can only do good!

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 3 
 
 
 
1.  Basic Concepts 
 
1.1  What is astrology 
 
Planets are constantly in motion with respect to ea rth in the skies. The positions of 
Sun, Moon and some planets close to earth can give important clues about the 
fortunes of individual human beings and groups of h uman beings. That  is the basic 
premise of astrology. How exactly we can make guess es about the fortunes of 
individual human beings and groups of human beings based on the positions of those 
planets in the skies is the question that we will a ttempt to answer in this book. While 
astrology is the subject that deals with this quest ion, there are many theories and 
philosophies in vogue and they are significantly different from each other. 
 
Sunsign astrology, for example, is based on categorizing people into 12 groups based 
on the solar month of birth. Some people may be con vinced, based on their 
experiences, that people born in the same month sha re certain qualities. It is, 
however, not very logical from a rational perspecti ve – there are just too many 
people in this world, who are totally different fro m each other. So the month of one's 
birth is totally inadequate for guessing one's natu re or fortune. Even the date and the 
hour of birth are not enough. We know that there ar e many  twins in this world, who 
are significantly different from each other! 
 
What we mentioned just now is, by the way, a very i mportant question to be 
answered – it is like an “acid test” for any astrol ogical doctrine. It is a known fact 
that there are many twins in this world, who are si gnificantly different from each 
other and who lead totally different lives. Of cour se, some twins may have some 
common qualities between them, but the fact remains  that several twins are 
significantly different. An astrological doctrine s hould be capable of explaining this 
fact in order to be considered as a meaningful subject. 
 
Most astrological doctrines of the world fail this acid test. If an astrological doctrine 
assumes, like in the case of many popular astrologi cal theories of the world, that two 
persons born within a couple of hours in nearby tow ns will have the same fortune, 

--- Page 16 ---
  
 
 4 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
then that doctrine is obviously lacking in complete ness and inadequate for confident 
use in real-life. It fails the acid test of twins. 
  
1.2  India's astrology 
 
Materialistically speaking, India may not be a rich  country today, but India has 
extremely rich cultural heritage. The depth of some  of India's ancient knowledge 
(like astrology) is just amazing and it makes one w onder if the history of this great 
civilization is correctly represented in the pages of modern history. Astrology of 
India is the most comprehensive and complete system  of astrology available today 
and it is the only one that comes close to answerin g the just mentioned “twins 
puzzle”. India's astrology can explain how twins ca n be different. The principles 
used in India's astrology are so sensitive to chang es in birthtime that people born 
within 1-2 minutes can be significantly different i n some aspects and similar in some 
others. This approach distinguishes between what a person truly is, what a person 
wants to be, what he thinks he is and what the worl d thinks he is. It has enough 
parameters, tools, techniques and degrees of freedo m to model the extremely 
complicated human life. 
 
This astrological approach is known in the world by  many names. Early pioneers of 
modern Indian astrology, like Dr. B.V. Raman, calle d it “Hindu astrology”, because 
this system was first taught by ancient Hindu sages . However, some people do not 
like this expression because “Hindu” is not a Sansk rit word. This word was later 
coined by the western invaders from the name of a r iver flowing on the northwestern 
border of India (river “Sindhu” or “Indus”). They u sed the word “Hindu” to describe 
the land and the people on the eastern side of this river. 
 
The religion practiced by a majority of Indians is known as “Hindu” religion today, 
but the fact is that there is no name for this reli gion in India's Sanskrit language, the 
language in which most of the literature of this re ligion – and astrology – appeared! 
Most other religions are known by the name of their  main propagator, but India's 
ancient religion had no single propagator or prophe t. This religion consisted of 
knowledge that revealed itself to spiritual masters  of many generations. So there was 
no name for this religion and the word “Hindu” coin ed by western invaders was 
accepted by the world. However, as already stressed , this word finds no place in 
Sanskrit literature. Some people do not like using a non-Sanskrit word to describe 

--- Page 17 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 5 
 
 
 
India's astrology, considering that most of India's  classical literature in astrology 
appeared in Sanskrit. 
 
Later day authors came up with the name – “Vedic as trology". The word “Vedic” 
means “pertaining to Vedas". Vedas are the sacred s criptures of, what is known 
today as, Hinduism and they are supposed to contain  knowledge of all subjects. 
Moreover, astrology in particular is supposed to be  a “Vedaanga” (which means a 
limb of Vedas). In particular, it is said to be the  eye of the Vedas. So the name 
“Vedic astrology” is becoming popular these days. T his author also suggests using 
“Vedic astrology” or “Jyotish” (meaning “science of  light"). Jyotishi is a practitioner 
of Jyotish, i.e.  a Vedic astrologer. 
 
1.3  Basics 
1.3.1  Grahas (planets) 
 
The words “planet” and “star” are used in a slightl y different sense in astrology than 
in astronomy. For example, Sun (a star) and Moon (a  satellite of earth) are called 
planets in astrology, along with Mars etc . Basically, a graha  or a planet is a body that 
has considerable influence on the living beings on earth. Distant stars have negligible 
influence on us, but Sun, Moon and planets in the solar system have a great influence 
on our activities. So the word graha  (or planet) is used to describe them. 
 
Seven planets are considered in Indian astrology. T hey are – Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and  Saturn . In addition, two “chaayaa grahas” (shadow 
planets) are considered in Indian astrology – Rahu  and Ketu . These are also called 
“the north node” and “the south node” respectively (or the head and tail of dragon). 
Rahu and Ketu are not real planets; they are just some mathematical points. 
 
Apart from these 9 planets, there are 11 moving mathematical points  known as 
Upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites). We also have lagna  (ascendant), which is the 
point that rises on the eastern horizon as the eart h rotates around itself. In addition, 
we have some mathematical points known as “ special ascendants" . 
 
1.3.2  Rasis (signs) 
 

--- Page 18 ---
  
 
 6 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
The positions of all these planets, upagrahas, lagn a and special lagnas in the zodiac 
are measured in degrees, minutes and seconds from the start of the zodiac (which is a 
fixed point in the sky). These positions are measur ed as seen from earth and they are 
called “geocentric positions". For the positions (c alculated in degrees, minutes and 
seconds) of planets, lagna, special lagnas and upag rahas, we also use the words 
longitude and sphuta . When watched from earth, the longitude of any pla net in the 
skies can be from 0 °0'0'' (0 degrees 0 minutes 0 seconds) to 359 °59'59''. It should be 
noted that 0 °0'0'' corresponds to the beginning of the zodiac. M any western 
astrologers consider Sayana  or tropical (moving) zodiac, whereas Nirayana  or 
sidereal (fixed) zodiac is considered in Vedic astrology. 
 
The zodiac (sky) lasts 360 ° as mentioned above and it is divided into 12 equal  parts. 
They are called “ rasis” (signs). English names, Sanskrit names, two-letter symbols 
and values of the start longitude and the end longi tude (in degrees, minutes and 
seconds) of all twelve rasis are given in Table 1. 
 
Table 1: Definition of Rasis 
Rasi name Sanskrit name Symbol Start End 
Aries Mesha Ar 0°0'0'' 29 °59'59'' 
Taurus Vrishabha/Vrisha Ta 30 °0'0'' 59 °59'59'' 
Gemini Mithuna Ge 60 °0'0'' 89 °59'59'' 
Cancer Karkataka/Karka Cn 90 °0'0'' 119 °59'59'' 
Leo Simha Le 120 °0'0'' 149 °59'59'' 
Virgo Kanya Vi 150 °0'0'' 179 °59'59'' 
Libra Thula Li 180 °0'0'' 209 °59'59'' 
Scorpio Vrischika Sc 210 °0'0'' 239 °59'59'' 
Sagittarius Dhanus Sg 240 °0'0'' 269 °59'59'' 
Capricorn Makara Cp 270 °0'0'' 299 °59'59'' 
Aquarius Kumbha Aq 300 °0'0'' 329 °59'59'' 
Pisces Meena Pi 330 °0'0'' 359 °59'59'' 
 
Notation 
: If a planet is at 221 °37', then you can find from Table 1 that it is betw een 
210 °0'0'' and 239 °59'59''. So, that planet is in Scorpio (or Vrischik a). Its 
advancement from the start  of the rasi occupied by is 11 °37'. Its position in the 
zodiac (221 °37') is shown by some people by the notation 11 °° °°37' in Sc or simply 11 
Sc 37 . This means “advanced by 11 °37' from the start of Sc (Scorpio)". Some people 

--- Page 19 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 7 
 
 
 
show it as 7s 11 ° 37' . This means “after completing 7 signs, advanced by  11 °37' in 
the 8 
th  sign (which is Scorpio)". 
 
Exercise 1: 
Jupiter is at 94 °19'. Mercury is at 5s 17 ° 45'. Venus is at 25 Li 31. For each of these 
planets, find ( a) the rasi occupied and ( b) the advancement from the start of the rasi 
occupied. 
 
Each rasi again has many kinds of divisions and the y are called “ vargas" . They will 
be defined in detail later. 
 
1.3.3  Bhavas (houses) 
 
Another important concept is “ house” (Sanskrit name: bhava ). In each chart, houses 
can be found with respect to several reference points and the reference points most 
commonly employed are lagna and special lagnas. Sta rting from the rasi occupied by 
the selected reference point and proceeding in the regular order across the zodiac, we 
associate each rasi with a house (first, second etc ). Always the rasi containing the 
reference point chosen is the 1 
st  house. Next rasi is the 2 nd  house. The rasi after that 
is the 3 rd  house. We proceed until the 12 th  house like that. Just remember that when 
we encounter Pisces, we go to Aries after it. If no  reference point is specified when 
houses are mentioned, it means that lagna  is used as the reference. 
 
If, for example, horalagna is in Cn, first house wi th respect to horalagna is in Cn. 
Second house is in Le (see Table 1). Third house is  in Vi. Ninth house is in Pi. Tenth 
house is in Ar. Eleventh house is in Ta. Twelfth house is in Ge. 
 
Exercise 2: 
 
(1)  Lagna is in Cn, Sun is in Ar, Moon is in Ta and Mar s is in Cp. Find the houses 
occupied by Sun, Moon and Mars. 
(2) Repeat the exercise, taking Moon as the reference point when finding houses. 
 
Different houses stand for different matters. Looki ng at the rasis and houses 
occupied by various planets, we can say a lot of th ings about the person. How 
exactly this is done will become clear in coming chapters.

1.3.4  Chakras (charts) 
 
A “ chart” (Sanskrit name: chakra ) is prepared with the information of rasis 
occupied by all planets. For preparing any chart, w e need to first determine the rasis 
occupied by all planets, upagrahas, lagna and speci al lagnas. In the visual 
representation of a chart, there are 12 boxes (are some other visual areas) with each 
representing a rasi. All planets, upagrahas and lag nas are written in the boxes 
corresponding to the rasis they occupy. 
 
There are 3 popular ways of drawing charts in India : (1) South Indian style chart 
ruled by Jupiter, (2) North Indian style diamond ch art ruled by Venus and (3) East 
Indian style Sun chart ruled by Sun. In this book, all the charts will be given in 
formats (1) and (2). 
 
Out of the three chart formats, (1) and (3) are ras i-based and (2) is bhava-based. In 
rasi-based chart drawing formats, a rasi is always at a fixed position. Ar is always in 
one particular position and Ta is in another positi on and so on. Planets, lagna etc  are 
placed in the box (or the visual area) representing  the rasi occupied by it. In bhava-
based chart drawing formats, a bhava (house) is alw ays at a fixed position. Lagna 
(denoted by “Asc” for ascendant) is always in a particular visual area of the chart and 
the 2 
nd , 3 rd  etc  houses are in fixed positions. 
 
Example 1: Let us take Lord Sree Rama’s rasi chart. The rasis  occupied by planets 
and lagna are given below. 
 
Ar – Sun; Ta – Mercury; Ge – Ketu; Cn – Ascendant ( lagna), Moon & Jupiter; Li – 
Saturn; Sg – Rahu; Cp – Mars; Pi – Venus.

Rasi chart for the above data is drawn in South Ind ian, North Indian and East Indian 
formats in Figure 1. In the south Indian chart, not ice the boxes containing Ar, Ta, Ge 
etc . In this format, these rasis will always be in the  same positions. The same holds 
for the east Indian format. The north Indian format  is different. Note the box 
containing “Asc” (ascendant – lagna). The same box will show the house containing 

--- Page 22 ---
  
 
 10 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
lagna in all north Indian format charts. It may be Ar in one chart, Ta in another and 
Ge in yet another. The number corresponding to the rasi (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta, 3 for Ge 
and so on) is shown in the box. For example, the bo x with “Asc” has 4 in it and it 
shows Cn. So the 1 st  house is in Cn. Please note the order in which hou ses are 
visually arranged in this chart. The same pattern will be used in all charts. 
 
N
OTE : Some people draw the east Indian format charts with an enclosing rectangle. 
 
1.3.5  Varga chakras (divisional charts) 
 
We saw that charts can be drawn with the informatio n of which planet occupies 
which rasi. Based on the longitude of a planet, we can find the rasi occupied by it 
and mark its position in rasi chart. 
 
In addition, we have what are known as “divisional charts” (Sanskrit name: varga 
chakras). These are based on dividing rasis into 2 parts, 3 parts, 4 parts and so on. 
We divide each rasi into n parts and map each part to a rasi again. Based on the rasis 
occupied by planets in these divisional mappings, w e draw divisional charts (or 
harmonic charts). Each divisional chart throws ligh t on a specific area of one’s life. 
In each divisional chart, we find houses and analyz e the chart as if it were an 
independent chart. The science of Vedic astrology s tands on the basis of 4 pillars – 
(1) grahas or planets, (2) rasis  or signs, (3) bhavas  or houses, and, (4) varga chakras 
or divisional charts. 
 
1.3.6  Nakshatras (constellations) 
 
In Vedic astrology, the zodiac is divided into 27 n akshatras. Each nakshatra has a 
length of 360º/27 = 13º 20'. The first nakshatra, f or example, stretches from the 
beginning of Aries to 13º 20' in Aries. The second nakshatra stretches from there to 
26º 40' in Aries. The third nakshatra stretches fro m there to 10º in Taurus. The list of 
nakshatras with the respective starting and ending points is given in Table 2. The 
table also gives the “Vimsottari lords” of all nakshatras. This will be used later. 
 
Each nakshatra is again divided into 4 quarters. Th ey are called padas (legs/feet). 
The length of a nakshatra pada is 3º 20'.

For the purpose of some special charts like Kota Ch akra and Sarvatobhadra Chakra, 
we consider 28 nakshatras. The last quarter of Utta rashadha is known as “Abhijit”. 
However, we consider 27 nakshatras for all other purposes. 
 
1.3.7  Solar Calendar 

--- Page 24 ---
  
 
 12 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
In solar calendar, one year is the time in which Su n moves by 360 ° and one month is 
the time in which Sun moves by 30 °. These are called “solar year” and “solar month” 
respectively. Each solar month has 30 days, where o ne day stands for exactly 1 ° 
motion of Sun). This calendar will be used in dasas and in Tajaka analysis. 
 
1.3.8  Tithis and Lunar Calendar 
1.3.8.1  Tithis 
 
In lunar calendar, one day stands for one tithi. Ti thi or lunar day is a period in which 
the difference between the longitudes of Moon and Sun changes by exactly 12 °.

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 13 
 
 
 
When Sun and Moon are at the same longitude, a new lunar month of 30 tithis starts. 
As time progresses, Moon will go ahead of Sun. When  Moon’s longitude is exactly 
12 ° greater than Sun’s longitude, the first tithi or l unar day finishes and the second 
tithi starts. When Moon’s longitude is exactly 24 ° greater than Sun’s longitude, the 
second tithi finishes and the third tithi starts. W hen Moon’s longitude is exactly 36 ° 
greater than Sun’s longitude, the third tithi finis hes and the fourth tithi starts. And so 
on. You can see that Sun-Moon longitude differential will be (12 
x n)° after exactly n 
tithis. 
 
A lunar month consists of 30 tithis. Each month is divided into two fortnights 
(pakshas ). During Sukla/Suddha paksha or the brighter fortn ight, Moon is waxing. 
During this paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an amou nt that is between 0º and 180º. 
During Krishna/Bahula paksha or the darker fortnigh t, Moon is waning. During this 
paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an amount that is between 180º and 360º. 
 
At the end of a month, Sun-Moon longitude different ial will be (12 
x 30) °, i.e. , 360 °. 
That means that Moon will finish one cycle around t he zodiac and catch up with Sun 
again. So Sun and Moon will be at the same longitud e again. Then a new month 
starts. 
 
We can find the tithi running on a day from the lon gitudes of Sun and Moon using 
the following procedure. 
 
(1)  Find the difference: (Moon’s longitude – Sun’s long itude). Add 360 ° if the result 
is negative. The result will be between 0 ° and 360 ° and will show how advanced 
Moon is with respect to Sun. 
(2)  Divide this result by 12 °. Ignore the remainder and take the quotient. 
(3)  Add 1 to the quotient. You get a number from 1 to 3 0. That will give the index of 
the tithi running. 
(4)  Refer to Table 3 and find the name of the tithi. Th ere are 15 tithis and the same 
tithis repeat in the brigher and darker fortnights. For example, it can be seen from 
the table that the 22 
th  tithi out of the 30 tithis is in Krishna paksha an d it is 
Saptami. So the 22 nd  tithi is “Krishna Saptami”. We write the classific ation of 
fortnight (Sukla or Krishna) first and then write t ithi name. “Sukla Saptami” 
stands for “Saptami” in the brighter fortnight (suk la paksha), i.e.  the 7 th  tithi. 
“Krishna Saptami” stands for “Saptami” in the darke r fortnight (krishna paksha), 
i.e.  the 22 nd  tithi.

 14 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Example 2: 
Let us say that Moon is at 24 °12' in Gemini. This is (2 x 30 °) + 24 ° 12' = 84 ° 12' 
from the beginning of the zodiac. 
 
Let us say that Sun is at 17 °46' in Scorpio. This is (7 x 30 °) + 17 ° 46' = 227 ° 46' 
from the beginning of the zodiac. 
 
Moon – Sun = 84 ° 12' – 227 ° 46' = –(143 ° 34'). It is negative because Sun is at a 
higher longitude. We have to add 360 ° to it to make it positive. It becomes 216 ° 26'. 
So this is the advancement of Moon with respect to Sun. 
 
Converting this to a decimal number, we get 216.43 °. We have to divide it by 12 °. 
We find 216.43 ÷ 12 and the quotient is 18. So 18 tithis are over. Adding 1 to it, we 
get 19 and so the 19 
th  tithi is running. Referring to Table 3, we see tha t this is 
“Chaturthi” tithi of Krishna paksha (darker fortnight). So it is “Krishna Chaturthi”. 
 
Exercise 3: Moon is at 14 °43' in Leo. Sun is at 28 °13' in Capricorn. Find the running 
tithi. 
 
1.3.8.2  Lunar Months 
 
We said that a new lunar month starts whenever Sun and Moon are at the same 
longitude. Then Moon will go ahead of Sun and, afte r about 29-30 days, he will 
catch up with Sun again. A new lunar month will start again. 
 
These lunar months go by special names. The name of  a lunar month is decided by 
the rasi in which Sun-Moon conjunction 
2 takes place. If Sun-Moon conjoin in Pisces, 
for example, it starts Chaitra maasa. These names c ome from the constellation that 
Moon is most likely to occupy on the full Moon day.  In the month that starts when 
Sun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, Moon is likely to b e in Chitra constellation (23 °20' 
                                                 
2 Two planets are said to be in “conjunction” if they are exactly at the same longitude. 
NOTE : However, we sometimes use this term approximately . If two planets are in the same sign, but 
not exactly at the same longitude, we still say that they are in conjunction.

in Virgo to 6 °40' in Libra) on the full Moon day (15 
th  tithi – Pournimasya). So the 
month is called Chaitra.

A solar year has about 365.2425 days, but a lunar y ear only has about 355 days. 
Once in every 3 years, this difference accumulates to one month and an extra lunar 
month comes. This results in Sun-Moon conjunction c oming twice in the same rasi. 
For example, Sun-Moon conjunction took place at 0 °23' in Taurus on May 15, 1999 
at 5:35:32 pm (IST) and again at 28 °29' in Taurus on June 14, 1999 at 12:33:27 am 
(IST). Sun-Moon conjunction in Taurus starts Jyesht ha maasa (maasa = month) as 
per Table 4. So 1999 had 2 Jyeshtha maasas. One is called “Nija” Jeshtha maasa and 
the other is called “Adhika” Jyeshtha maasa. Nija m eans real and adhika means 
extra. An adhika maasa (extra month) comes once in every 3 years and that 
synchronizes the lunar years with solar years. This  calendar has been in use in India 
for millennia. 
 
1.3.9  Yogas 
 
Add the longitudes of Sun and Moon. Remove 360º fro m the sum if it is greater than 
360º. Divide the sum by the length of one nakshatra (13 °20' or 800'). Ignore fractions 

--- Page 28 ---

and take the integer part. Add 1 to it and the resu lt is the index of the yoga running. 
Refer to Table 5 and find the yoga corresponding to the index.

24 Sukla White, bright 
25 Brahma Creator (good knowledge and purity) 
26 Indra Ruler of gods 
27 Vaidhriti A class of gods 
 
Example 3: Suppose Sun is at 23 °50' in Cp and Moon is at 17 °20' in Li. Then Sun’s 
longitude is 23 °50' + 9 
x 30 ° = 293 °50' and Moon’s longitude is 17 °20' + 6 x 30 ° = 
197 °20'. The sum is 293 °50' + 197 °20' = 491 °10'. By subtracting 360º, we get 

--- Page 29 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 17 
 
 
 
131 °10'. This is equivalent to 131 
x 60 + 10 =  7870'. By dividing this with 800', we 
get 9.8375. Ignoring the fraction, we get 9. Adding  1 to it, we get 10. From Table 5, 
we see that the 10 th  yoga is “Ganda yoga”. 
 
Exercise 4: Moon is at 14 °43' in Leo. Sun is at 28 °13' in Capricorn. Find the running 
Sun-Moon yoga. 
 
1.3.10  Karanas 
 
Each tithi is divided into 2 karanas. There are 11 karanas: (1) Bava, (2) Balava, (3) 
Kaulava, (4) Taitula, (5) Garija, (6) Vanija, (7) V ishti, (8) Sakuna, (9) Chatushpada, 
(10) Naga, and, (11) Kimstughna. The first 7 karana s repeat 8 times starting from the 
2
nd  half of the first lunar day of a month. The last 4  karanas come just once in a 
month, starting from the 2 nd  half of the 29 th  lunar day and ending at the 1 st  half of the 
first lunar day. 
 
1.3.11  Hora 
 
Each day starts at sunrise and ends at next day’s s unrise. This period is divided into 
24 equal parts and they are called horas. A hora is  almost equal to an hour. These 
horas are ruled by different planets. The lords of hora come in the order of 
decreasing speed with respect to earth: Saturn, Jup iter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury 
and Moon. After Moon, we go back to Saturn and repeat the 7 planets. 
 
The first hora of any day ( i.e.  a period of one hour following sunrise) is ruled b y the 
lord of the weekday (Sun for Sunday, Moon for Monda y, Mars for Tuesday, 
Mercury for Wednesday, Jupiter for Thursday, Venus for Friday and Saturn for 
Saturday). After that, we list planets in the order mentioned above. 
 
For example, let us take 9:40 pm on a Wednesday on which sunrise was at 6:10 am. 
The time elapsed since sunrise is 21:40 – 6:10 = 15 :30. So the 16 
th  hour since sunrise 
was running then. This is ruled by the 16 th  planet from Mercury. After subtracting 
multiples of 7 from 16, we get 2. So the hora (hour ) is ruled by the 2 nd  planet from 
Mercury. From the list given above, we see that the  2 nd  planet from Mercury is 
Moon. So Moon’s hora runs at 9:40 pm.

 18 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
1.3.12  Panchaanga 
 
Panchaanga means “one with 5 limbs”. Almanacs publi shed in India with planetary 
positions are traditionally called panchaangas. Alo ng with the planetary positions, 
they give the start and end times of tithi, vaara ( week day – Sunday, Monday etc ), 
nakshatra, yoga and karana running on each day. The se five are the limbs of 
panchaanga. 
 
When we choose a muhurta (an auspicious time for st arting a venture), we should 
choose an auspicious tithi, vaara, nakshatra, yoga and karana. 
 
1.3.13  Ayanamsa 
 
Because of the movement in earth’s precession, the starting point of the tropical 
zodiac changes slowly (with respect to fixed stars) . Tropical (sayana) zodiac is 
analogous to measuring the positions of trees and b uildings sitting in a slowly 
moving bus. Sidereal (nirayana) zodiac, on the othe r hand, considers a fixed zodiac. 
It considers the motion of the tropical zodiac (bus  in our analogy) and makes an 
adjustment accordingly. We use the sidereal zodiac in Vedic astrology. The 
difference between the tropical zodiac and the side real zodiac is of great importance. 
What modern ephemeris gives us is the tropical posi tions of planets. To convert 
these positions, we have to subtract the difference  between the two zodiacs. This 
difference varies with time. As earth’s precession changes every year, the difference 
between the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac  changes. This difference is called 
“ayanamsa” (sidereal difference). There are many op inions on the correct value of 
ayanamsa, because nobody knows exactly which star i s supposed to be the starting 
point of the real zodiac. We will use Chitrapaksha/ Lahiri ayanamsa in this book, 
which is accepted by most Vedic astrologers of India. 
 
1.4  Dasa Systems 
 
Dasa systems are a hallmark of Vedic astrology. Ved ic astrology has hundreds of 
dasa system. Each dasa system divides one’s life in to periods, sub-periods, sub-sub-
periods and so on. All the periods are ruled by different planets or rasis. Some dasa 
systems are planet-based and some are rasi-based. E ach dasa system is good at 
showing events of a specific nature. For each dasa system, we have some standard 

--- Page 31 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 19 
 
 
 
rules, based on which we analyze the natal chart an d attribute different results to 
different periods and sub-periods. Each dasa system  comes with rules for dividing 
one’s life into periods and sub-periods and rules f or attributing different results to 
different periods, based on the planetary positions  in the natal chart. These periods 
are called “dasas” or “mahadasas” (MD). Sub-periods  are called “antardasas” (AD). 
Sub-sub-periods are called “pratyantardasas” (PD). 
 
Some dasas are good at showing matters related to l ongevity and death. They are 
called “ayur dasas” (dasas of longevity). Some dasa s are good at showing general 
results. They are called “phalita dasas” (dasas of general results). 
 
Mind is a very important part of our existence and Moon governs it. Some dasas are 
computed based on the nakshatra occupied by Moon an d they are called “nakshatra 
dasas”. Some dasas are based on the rasis occupied by planets and they are called 
“rasi dasas”. 
 
We will learn 10 different dasa systems in this boo k. Readers should not look at 
these 10 dasas as ten different alternatives to look at the same life event. They should 
instead be looked at as ways to look at 10 differen t aspects of the same life event. In 
fact, some of the dasas taught in this book are lim ited to specific matters. For 
example, we should look at Drigdasa for spiritual p rogress and we should look at 
Sudasa for money and wealth. Like that, some dasas are limited to specific matters. 
 
1.5  Conclusion 
 
The content of this chapter may be too rudimentary for most readers. However, for 
beginners, it may be confusing.  
 
The content of the first several chapters of this b ook may seem to be disjoint, but 
things will fall in place as we go on. Readers shou ld patiently go through the 
material in the order presented. One has to work ha rd on the basics. Once the basics 
are clear, Vedic astrology is a very systematic subject. 
 
Some Western astrologers mix Western astrology with  Vedic astrology and bring in 
progressions, extra-Saturnine planets etc  into Vedic astrology. It is silly to suggest 
that the Sages who taught such brilliant and superf ine techniques did not consider 
some planets because they did not know about them. Vedic astrology is a very 

--- Page 32 ---
  
 
 20 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
logical and systematic subject and there is no need to corrupt it . There are some 
techniques of western astrology that are not used b y most contemporary Vedic 
astrologers but were taught by seers. We can accept  those techniques. An example is 
progressions. They were not taught by Parasara, but  they were taught by Manu. So 
we can accept them. But the use of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were not taught by 
any seers of Vedic astrology. We should first striv e to clearly understand the 
teachings of maharshis. There is a lot of width and  depth in the knowledge taught by 
maharshis. Our focus should be on understanding their teachings correctly and not on 
adding new things to the knowledge that we only superficially understand. 
 
Western astrologers reading this book may have to unlearn  some things they learnt 
before, as they read this book.

2.  Rasis 
 
2.1  Introduction 
 
We learnt that the zodiac of 360º is divided into 1 2 equal parts of 30º. We learnt 
these are called rasis (signs). We learnt the defin ition of rasis in Table 1. Different 
rasis have different properties and they stand for different things. We will learn them 
in this small chapter. 
 
2.2  Characteristics of Rasis 
 
2.2.1  Limbs of Vishnu 
 
The whole zodiac is nothing but a manifestation of Lord Vishnu’s body. Aries is the 
head. Taurus is the face. Gemini is the arms. Cance r is the heart. Leo is the stomach. 
Virgo is the hip. Libra is the space below navel. S corpio is the private parts. 
Sagittarius is the thighs. Capricorn is the knees. Aquarius is the ankles. Pisces is the 
feet. 
 
These are the limbs that rasis in the natural zodia c stand for. Because we are all part 
of the Supreme energy governing this world, the abo ve mapping applies to us too. 
For example, we should pay attention to Leo for ana lyzing stomach problems and to 
Pisces for analyzing problems related to feet and so on. 
 
2.2.2  Odd and Even 
 
(1)  Ar, Ge, Le, Li, Sg and Aq are called odd rasis or vishama rasis or oja rasis. They 
are also known as male rasis. 
(2)  Ta, Cn, Vi, Sc, Cp and Pi are called even  rasis or sama  rasis or yugma  rasis. They 
are also known as female rasis. 
 
This division is used in some dasas and in the determination of the sex of children.

2.2.3  Odd-footed and Even-footed 
 
(1)  Ar, Ta, Ge, Li, Sc and Sg are called odd-footed rasis or vishamapada rasis or 
ojapada rasis. 
(2)  Cn, Le, Vi, Cp, Aq and Pi are called even-footed  rasis or samapada  rasis or or 
yugmapada  rasis. 
 
This division is used in some dasas. 
 
2.2.4  Movable, Fixed and Dual 
 
(1)  Ar, Cn, Li and Cp are known as chara  rasis or movable rasis. They are ruled by 
Brahma, the Creator. Their nature is to move and to be dynamic. 
(2)  Ta, Le, Sc and Aq are known as sthira rasis or fixed rasis. They are ruled by 
Shiva, the Destroyer. Their nature is to be stable and constant. 
(3)  Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi are known as dwiswabhava rasis or dual rasis. They are ruled 
by Vishnu, the Sustainer. 
3 They are stable sometimes and dynamic sometimes. 
 
2.2.5  Rasis & Five Elements 
 
According to Hindu philosophy, this world is made u p of 5 elements – fire, water, 
air, earth and ether. Water is a substance with a f lexible state. Air is a substance with 
a varying state. Earth is a substance with a consta nt and solid state. Fire is a 
substance that transforms the state of things. Ethe r is something that is present 
everywhere. 
 
For example, suppose one has a good memory and reme mbers something he learnt 
10 years back. It involves a skill of earthy nature . Suppose a poet’s imagination 
creates a nice poem that appeals to one’s aesthetic  sense. This involves watery skills. 
Suppose one is in a bad mood and his mind is wander ing aimlessly. This shows airy 
state of the mind. These 5 elements are behind ever y material substance, every 
action, every thought, every emotion and every happening in this universe. 
                                                
 
3 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together form the Trinity  of Hindu Gods. Brahma creates the world. 
Vishnu sustains it. Shiva destroys it.

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 23 
 
 
 
 
(1)  Ar, Le and Sg are called agni rasis or fiery rasis. 
(2)  Ta, Vi and Cp are called bhoo rasis or earthy rasis. 
(3)  Ge, Li and Aq are called vaayu rasis or airy rasis. 
(4)  Cn, Sc and Pi are called jala rasis or watery rasis. 
(5)  The 5 
th  element of aakaasa or ether  is present in every rasi. 
 
Let us see how these may be used. For example, the 5 
th  house in one’s chart shows 
one’s emotional nature. The 5 th  house in a fiery sign may show a normally angry, 
aggressive or determined person. The 5 th  house in an earthy sign may show a 
balanced, logical and stable person. The 5 th  house in an airy sign may show someone 
with unstable and wandering emotions. The 5 th  house in a watery sign may show one 
with an imaginative and creative mind. 
 
2.2.6  Pitta, Vaata and Kapha 
 
Ayurveda is India’s Vedic medical system that recog nizes human body and 
everything else in the universe as having 3 natures  that are formed with the above 5 
elements: 
 
Pitta  or bilious  nature is a combination of the elements of fire an d water. It shows 
things that result in tranformation in a system. In  a human body, for example, it may 
show digestion etc . 
 
Vaata  or windy nature is a combination of the elements of air and ether. It shows 
things that move in and out of a system. In a human  body, for example, it may show 
breathing etc . 
 
Kapha  or phlegmatic  nature is a combination of the elements of earth a nd water. It 
shows things that bind a system together. In a human body, for example, it may show 
bones, muscles, fat etc . It shows things that give a structure to a system. 
 
Ar, Le and Sg are of pitta nature. Ta, Vi and Cp are of vaata nature. Cn, Sc and Pi are 
of kapha nature. Ge, Li and Aq are of a mixed nature.

2.2.7  Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas 
 
In Hindu philosophy, everything in this universe ha s one of 3 gunas (qualities). They 
are called trigunas. Sattwa (purity) is a quality that gives truthfulness and p urity. 
Rajas or rajo  guna (energy) is a quality that makes one energeti c and passionate. 
Tamas or tamo guna (darkness) is a quality that makes one depraved. 
 
As an example, let us say a saint is living in a sm all hermitage. Let us say a man 
living in a local forest comes, makes fun of the sa int and abuses him for no reason. 
Let us say a king fights with that man after findin g out about this. Let us say that the 
saint tells him to leave the man and yet the king punishes him. 
 
The saint shows sattva guna and he is not bothered by petty things. He ignores the 
abuse. He is a pure person. The man abusing the sai nt for no reason shows tamo 
guna, as he is in the dark. Abusing a saattwik pers on for no reason is a pathetic thing 
to do and only a depraved person in darkness can do  it. The king acts appropriatesly 
and shows his energy by defeating the man. So far i t is sattwa guna (the state of 
being true). But the king punishes the man ignoring  the advice of the saint to forgive 
him. His passionate response makes him a person with rajo guna. 
 
(1) Saattwik signs, i.e.  signs with sattwa guna, are – Cn, Le, Sg, Pi. 
(2) Raajasik signs, i.e.  signs with rajo guna, are – Ar, Ta, Li, Sc.  
(3) Taamasik signs, i.e.  signs with tamo guna, are – Ge, Vi, Cp, Aq. 
 
2.2.8  Rasis and Directions 
 
(1)  Ar, Le and Sg show east. 
(2)  Ta, Vi and Cp show south. 
(3)  Ge, Li and Aq show west. 
(4)  Cn, Sc and Pi show north. 
 
2.2.9  Rasis and Colors 
 
Ar shows blood-red color. Ta shows white. Ge shows grass green. Cn shows pale 
red. Le shows white. Virgo is variegated. Libra sho ws black. Scorpio shows reddish 

--- Page 37 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 25 
 
 
 
brown. Sagittarius shows the color of the husk of g rass. Capricorn is variegated. 
Aquarius shows brown color (that of a mongoose). Pi sces shows cream color or the 
the color of fish. 
 
2.2.10  Day and Night 
 
(1)  Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Sg and Cp are night time rasis – they are strong during the night 
time. They are nishaa rasis. 
(2)  Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq and Pi are daytime rasis – they are strong during the daytime. 
They are divaa  rasis. 
 
Out of the two rasis owned by a planet, one is a da y sign and one is a night sign. 
Moon governs all the nishaa rasis and Sun governs all the divaa rasis. 
 
2.2.11  Rising of rasis 
 
Some rasis rise with their head. They are called “S eershodaya rasis”. Some rasis rise 
with their feet 
4. They are called “Prishthodaya rasis”. 
 
(1)  Ge, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq are Seershodaya rasis. 
(2)  Ar, Ta, Cn, Sg, Cp are Prishthodaya rasis. 
(3)  Pi rises with both its head and feet. 
 
It is said that planets in Seershodaya rasis give t heir results in the first half of their 
dasas and planets in Prishthodaya rasis give their results in the second half of their 
dasas. 
 
2.2.12  Varna or Class 
 
In Hinduism, people are divided into 4 varnas or classes – (1) Brahmanas, (2) 
Kshatriyas, (3) Vaisyas and (4) Sudras. Brahmanas p ursue knowledge and work as 
priests or ministers. Kshatriyas are valiant and th ey become kings, army chiefs and 
                                                
 
4 Many scholars have interpreted “prishthodaya” as “ rising with the feet”. So we will use the same 
interpretation. However, strictly speaking, one should note that “prishtha” means “back”. 

--- Page 38 ---
  
 
 26 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
soldiers. Vaisyas are the traders and suppliers of various services. Sudras execute 
various menial tasks. 
 
(1)  Brahmanas (scholars) are represented by watery signs – Cn, Sc, Pi. 
(2)  Kshatriyas (warriors) are represented by by fiery signs – Ar, Le, Sg. 
(3)  Vaisyas (traders) are represented by by earthy signs – Ta, Vi, Cp. 
(4)  Sudras (workers) are represented by by airy signs – Ge, Li, Aq.

3.  Planets 
 
3.1  Introduction 
 
There are 7 grahas (planets) in Vedic astrology: Su n, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Saturn. There are two more chaayaa grahas  (shadow planets): Rahu and 
Ketu. Rahu and Ketu are mathematical points. They a re also called the north and 
south nodes or the head and tail of dragon. They ar e based on the points at which the 
orbit of Moon around earth cuts the orbit of earth around Sun. 
 
Rasis represent situations that develop in one’s li fe and influences that enter one’s 
life. Planets in a chart represent human beings that play a role in one’s life. 
 
Just as the whole zodiac represents Lord Vishnu and  rasis represent His limbs, 
planets represent Vishnu’s avataras (incarnations). 
 
3.2  Characteristics of Planets 
 
3.2.1  Vishnu’s Avataras 
 
This world contains two essences – jeevaamsa (livin g essence) and paramaatmaamsa 
(absolute and supreme essence). Planets are the man ifestations of different aspects of 
these essences. Vishnu’s incarnations happened with  these essences taken from 
various planets. 
 
Meena/Matsya avatara (fish) came from Ketu. Koorma avatara (tortoise) came from 
Saturn. Varaaha/sookara avatara (boar) came from Ra hu. Narasimha/Nrisimha 
avatara (half-man, half-lion) came from Mars. Vaama na avatara (learned dwarf) 
came from Jupiter. Parasu Rama/Bhaargava Rama came from Venus. Rama came 
from Sun. Krishna came from Moon. Buddha came from Mercury. 
 

--- Page 41 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 29 
 
 
 
All these incarnations came into being with a signi ficant percentage of 
paramaatmaamsa (supreme essence) than jeevaatmaamsa  (living essence). Rama, 
Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha avataras had only paramaatmaamsa. 
 
Other living beings are born with a significant percentage of jeevaamsa and a little of 
paramaatmaamsa from the planets. 
 
3.2.2  Benefics and Malefics 
 
(1)  Jupiter and Venus are natural benefics  (saumya grahas or subha grahas). 
Mercury becomes a natural benefic when he is alone or with more natural 
benefics. Waxing Moon of Sukla paksha is a natural benefic. 
(2)  Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu are natural malefics  (kroora grahas or paapa grahas). 
Mercury becomes a natural malefic when he is joined  by more natural malefics. 
Waning Moon of Krishna paksha is a natural malefic. 
 
This information is important because the results g iven by planets are based on their 
inherent nature. 
 
3.2.3  Main Governance 
 
Sun governs soul. Moon governs mind. Mars governs s trength. Mercury governs 
speech. Jupiter governs knowledge and happiness. Ve nus governs potency. Saturn 
governs grief. 
 
3.2.4  Planets and Colors 
 
Sun shows blood-red color. Moon shows tawny color. Mars shows blood-red color. 
Mercury shows grass green color. Jupiter shows tawn y color. Venus is variegated. 
Saturn shows black color. 
 
These colors can be useful, for example, when predi cting the color of one’s car. For 
now, readers should just memorize these characteristics. 
 
3.2.5  Planetary Cabinet 
 

--- Page 42 ---
  
 
 30 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Sun and Moon are kings. Mars is the leader (army ch ief). Mercury is the prince. 
Jupiter and Venus are the ministers. Saturn is the servant. Rahu and Ketu form the 
army. 
 
3.2.6  Planetary Deities 
 
Ruling deities of various planets are as given belo w: Agni (fire god) for Sun, Varuna 
(rain god) for Moon, Subrahmanya (army chief of god s) for Mars,  Maha Vishnu 
(supreme sustaining force) for Mercury, Indra (rule r of gods) for Jupiter, Sachi Devi 
(Indra’s wife) for Venus, Brahma (Creator) for Saturn. 
 
3.2.7  Sex of Planets 
 
Sun, Mars and Jupiter are male. Moon and Venus are female. Saturn and Mercury 
are female. 
 
This information can be used for predicting the sex  of children based on one’s chart. 
For example, if the house ruling the first child is  influenced by Jupiter, Mars and 
Mercury, we may predict a son. If it is influenced by Moon and Mercury, we may 
predict a daughter. 
 
3.2.8  Planets & Five Elements 
 
(1)  Agni tattva (fiery element) is ruled by Mars. Sun also has the same nature. 
(2)  Bhoo tattva (earthy element) is ruled by Mercury. 
(3)  Vaayu tattva (airy element) is ruled by Saturn. 
(4)  Aakaasa tattva (ethery element) is ruled by Jupiter. 
(5)  Jala tattva (watery element) is ruled by Venus. Moon also has the same nature. 
 
These rulerships throw light on the basic nature of planets. Being a fiery planet, Mars 
governs leadership, enterprise etc . Being an earthy planet, Mercury governs memory, 
logical abilities etc . Being an airy planet, Saturn governs wandering an d free spirit. 
Being a watery planet, Venus governs imaginative an d creative work. Being an 
ethery planet, Jupiter governs wisdom, intelligence and perceiving knowledge. 
 
3.2.9  Planets & Varnas 
 

--- Page 43 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 31 
 
 
 
Jupiter and Venus are Brahmanas (learned). Sun and Mars are Kshatriyas (warriors). 
Moon and Mercury are Vaisyas (traders). Saturn is a Sudra (worker). 
 
Learning and intelligence is the forte of the learn ed class. Bravery is the forte of the 
warrior class. Getting along with others well is th e forte of the trader class. Hard 
work is the forte of the working class. In this man ner, we should understand varnas 
to show one’s basic nature rather than the caste of one’s family. 
 
It should be noted that Moon, who was earlier class ified in the planetary cabinet as a 
king, is said here to be of Vaisya varna. Sun is a king who is also a warrior. He is a 
brave king, who asserts himself. But Moon is a king  who gets along well with 
everyone. 
 
3.2.10  Planets & Gunas 
 
Sun, Moon and Jupiter are saattwik planets. Mercury  and Venus are raajasik planets. 
Mars and Saturn are taamasik planets. 
 
N
OTE : There is a misconception today that sattwa guna m eans patience and not 
hurting others. An aggressive response to an offend er is often thought to be raajasik. 
However, sattwa simply means “the state of being tr ue”. Pleasing others with 
artificial goodness is not  sattwa guna. Punishing a person for his mistakes i s not 
necessarily rajo guna. If there is some passion and  impurity in one’s energetic 
response, then it shows rajo guna. But, if a warrio r fights a sinning person with no 
passion or ego, it can still be a saattvic act. Lor d Sri Rama and Sun are examples for 
this. Sun is a king of the warrior class and yet he  is saattwik. Lord Rama, who was 
born with his amsa, is a saattwik person despite killing Ravana and other demons. 
 
Sattva guna simply means purity and truthfulness in  one’s thoughts and action. Rajo 
guna shows some passion, energy and impurity in tho ughts and actions. Tamo guna 
shows a dark, mean and depraved spirit in thoughts and actions. 
 
3.2.11  Planetary Abodes 
 
Sun lives in a temple. Moon lives in a watery place . Mercury lives in a sports 
ground. Jupiter lives in a treasure house. Venus li ves in the bedroom. Saturn lives in 
a filthy area. 

--- Page 44 ---
  
 
 32 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
This description should give one an idea of the nature of planets. 
 
3.2.12  Seven Dhaatus 
 
Sapta dhaatus or 7 matters make up human body. The planetary rulerships are as 
follows: Sun rules bones. Moon rules blood. Mars ru les marrow. Mercury rules skin. 
Jupiter rules fat. Venus rules semen (materials rel ated to the reproductive system). 
Saturn rules muscles. 
 
If Sun is afflicted, it can show some problems rela ted to bones. Weakness of Moon 
may give blood related problems. And so on. 
 
3.2.13  Planets & Time Periods 
 
Sun rules an ayana 
5. Moon rules a minute. Mars rules a week. Mercury r ules a ritu 6. 
Jupiter rules a month. Venus rules a fortnight. Saturn rules a year. 
 
These periods are very useful in prasna or horary astrology. 
 
3.2.14  Planets & Tastes 
 
Sun governs the pungent taste ( e.g.  onion, ginger, pepper). Moon governs the saline 
taste ( e.g.  sea salt, rock salt). Mars governs the bitter tast e ( e.g.  karela/bitter melon, 
dandelion root, rhubarb root, neem leaves). Mercury  governs a mixed taste. Jupiter 
governs sweetness ( e.g. sugar, dates). Venus governs the sour taste ( e.g.  lemon, 
tamarind). Saturn governs the astringent taste ( e.g.  plantain, pomegranate). 
 
The 2 
nd  house shows one’s preference in food. The planets influencing it may decide 
one’s favorite taste. In addition, one should avoid  the tastes of the planets who are 
likely bring disease. Suppose one is running a dasa  or antardasa of a sign containing 
Moon as per Shoola dasa (a dasa that shows sufferin g). Then some suffering related 
to Moon is possible. Moon can give problems related to blood pressure as he governs 
                                                 
5 There are 2 ayanas in a year. During Sun’s transit  from Cp to Ge, we have Uttara (north) ayana. 
During Sun’s transit from Cn to Sg, we have Dakshina (south) ayana. 
6 Ritu roughly means a “season”. There are 6 ritus i n a year. They are – vasanta (spring), greeshma 
(summer), varsha (rain), hemanta (dew), seeta (winter), sisira (fall). Each ritu consists of 2 months. 

--- Page 45 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 33 
 
 
 
blood. So eating too much salty food during such a period may result in high blood 
pressure. Similarly, one should cut down on sweets during a period in which Jupiter 
related troubles are indicated. Or, one may develop  too much fat (Jupiter) or get 
other Jupiter related diseases. 
 
3.2.15  Planetary Strengths 
 
Mercury and Jupiter are strong in the eastern direc tion (lagna). Sun and Mars are 
strong in the southern direction (meridian – 10 
th  house). Moon and Venus are strong 
in the northern direction (nadir – 4 th  house). Saturn is strong in the west (7 th  house). 
These are the digbalas (strengths associated with d irection) of planets. These show 
the direction taken by one in one’s life, as we will see later. 
 
Moon, Mars and Saturn are strong in the night time.  Sun, Jupiter and Venus are 
strong in the daytime. Mercury is always strong. 
 
Natural malefics are strong in Krishna paksha. Natu ral benefics are strong in Sukla 
paksha. 
 
Natural malefics are strong in Dakshina ayana 
7. Natural benefics are strong in Uttara 
ayana. 
 
3.2.16  Planets & Ritus 
 
Planetary rulerships over ritus (seasons) are as fo llows: Venus governs vasanta ritu 
(spring). Mars governs greeshma ritu (summer). Moon  governs varsha ritu (rainy 
season). Mercury governs hemanta ritu (season of de w). Jupiter governs seeta ritu 
(winter). Saturn governs sisira ritu (fall). 
 
3.2.17  Dhatu, Moola and Jeeva 
 
(1)  Rahu, Mars, Saturn and Moon rule over dhaatus (metals and materials). 
(2)  Sun and Venus rule over moolas (roots and vegetables). 
(3)  Mercury, Jupiter and Ketu rule over jeevas (living beings).

3.3  Planetary Dignities 
 
Each planet has a sign where it is exalted ( uchcha ), a sign where it is debilitated 
(neecha ), a sign that is called its moolatrikona and one or two rasis that are owned  by 
it. A planet is said to be strong in its own rasi or exaltation rasi or moolatrikona. 
 
Table 6 shows own rasis, exaltation rasis, the degr ee of deep exaltation, debilitation 
rasi, the degree of deep debilitation and the moolatrikona of each planet.

Venus Ta & Li Pi (27º) Vi (27º) Li 
Saturn Cp & Aq Li (20º) Ar (20º) Aq 
Rahu Aq Ge Sg Vi 
Ketu Sc Sg Ge Pi 
 
Some special points regarding the results given by planets: 
 
(1)  Sun gives the results of being in moolatrikona in t he first 20º of Le and the 
results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10º. 
(2)  Moon gives the results of being in exaltation rasi in the first 3º of Ta and the 
results of being in moolatrikona in the remaining 27º. 
(3)  Mars gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 12º of Le and the 
results of being in own rasi in the remaining 18º. 
(4)  Mercury gives the results of being in exaltation ra si in the first 15º of Vi, the 
results of being in moolatrikona in the next 5º and the results of being in own rasi 
in the remaining 10º. 

--- Page 47 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 35 
 
 
 
(5)  Jupiter gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 10º of Sg and the 
results of being in own rasi in the remaining 20º. 
(6)  Venus gives the results of being in moolatrikona in  the first half of Li and the 
results of being in own rasi in the second half of Li. 
(7)  Saturn gives the results of being in moolatrikona i n the first 20º of Aq and the 
results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10º. 
 
An analogy may help one understand the subtle diffe rence between own rasi, 
exaltation rasi and moolatrikona. 
 
Own rasi of a planet ( e.g.  Pisces of Jupiter) is like one’s home. One is most  natural 
and comfortable at home. That is exactly what a planet in own rasi is. Moolatrikona 
of a planet ( e.g.  Sagittarius of Jupiter) is like one’s office. One executes one’s formal 
job and performs one’s duty at office. One is power ful and duty-minded at office. 
Exaltation sign of a planet ( e.g.  Cancer of Jupiter) is like a favorite party/picnic . One 
is excited to be at one’s favorite party/picnic. So  an exalted planet is like an excited 
person at his favorite picnic spot. Debilitation si gn of a planet ( e.g.  Capricorn of 
Jupiter) is like one’s worst party. A debilitated planet is like an unhappy person stuck 
at a place he hates. 
 
Jupiter is a saattwik and dharmik Brahmin. Ethery J upiter, planet of perception, 
intelligence and wisdom, is most comfortable in saa ttwik Pisces, which is the 12 
th  
house of the natural zodiac. That is his home. Howe ver, he also has to uphold 
dharma. Upholding dharma is his duty . Whether he likes it or not, he has to do it. So 
fiery Sagittarius, 9th house in the natural zodiac,  is his moolatrikona. Jupiter is like a 
"raaja purohit" (chief priest of a king) in Sagittarius. He has to sometimes take strong 
decisions to uphold dharma (like sentencing someone to death). In Pisces, he is like a 
peaceful Brahmin doing pooja at his home. In watery  Cancer, the 4th house of the 
natural zodiac, Jupiter is excited to do some imagi native (watery) learning (4 th  house 
matter). In taamasik and earthy Capricorn, the 10th  house of the natural zodiac, 
Jupiter hates doing tamasik and well-defined karma (action, 10 th  house matter). It is 
against his nature. Executing well-defined taamasik  karma may be fine with 
taamasik planets Mars and Saturn, but Jupiter is un happy with it. So Jupiter is 
debilitated in Cp.

Take Mercury as another example. He is an intellect ual planet and significator of 
communications. “Intelligent communication” is the most comfortable activity for 
him. So his home is intellectual Gemini, the 3rd ho use (communications) of the 
natural zodiac. However, intelligent debates and ar guments are the formal job 
assigned to him. Virgo is the 6th house (arguments)  of the natural zodiac and it is 
Mercury’s moolatrikona! 
 
While saattwik and ethery Jupiter doesn't quite lov e the job of fiercely and fierily 
upholding dharma (by punishing demon king Bali in V aamana avatara, for example), 
he does it with a sense of duty. But Mercury loves his official job! He loves engaging 
in intellectual debates. So Virgo (6th house of the  natural zodiac) is not only his 
moolatrikona (office), but also his exaltation sign  (favorite picnic spot). Still, 
"intelligent communications" (Gemini) is what he is most comfortable with (home). 
 
Let us take one final example – Ketu. Ketu is most comfortable with occult activity, 
which are shown by the 8 
th  house. So he owns the 8 th  house of the natural zodiac, i.e.  
Scorpio. His official duty, however, is giving upaa sana (meditation) and moksha 
(liberation), which are shown by the 12 th  house. So his moolatrikona is in the 12 th  
house of the natural zodiac, i.e.  Pisces. 
 
One should remember the above and understand the mo od of a planet based on 
whether it is in own rasi or exaltation rasi or moo latrikona. Though all the three are 
good placements, there is a subtle difference in the mood of the planet and the results 
given by it. 
 
3.4  Planetary Relationships 
 
3.4.1  Natural Relationships 
 
For each planet, its friends and enemies are found as follows: Take the moolatrikona 
of the planet. Lord of the rasi where it is exalted is its friend. Lords of 2 
nd , 4 th , 5 th , 8 th , 
9th  and 12 th  rasis from it are also its natural friends. Lords of other rasis are its natural 
enemies. If a planet becomes a friend and an enemy on account of owning two rasis, 
then it is a neutral planet. The list of friends, n eutral planets and enemies of all 
planets is listed in Table 7.

3.4.2  Temporary Relationships 
 
In addition to the permanent relationship, we have temporary relationships based on 
the planetary position in a chart. These temporary ( tatkaala ) relationships are 
specific to a chart. 
 
Planets occupying the 2 
nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 10 th , 11 th  and 12 th  rasis counted from the rasi 
occupied by a planet are its temporary friends. Pla net occupying other rasis are its 
temporary enemies. 
 
Example 4: Let us consider Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Fi gure 1 and find the 
temporary friends and temporary enemies of Sun and Moon. 
 
Sun : Sun is in Ar. The 2 
nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 10 th , 11 th  and 12 th  rasis counted from Ar are Ta, 
Ge, Cn, Cp, Aq and Pi. Planets in those rasis are M ercury, Moon, Jupiter, Mars and 
Venus. They are temporary friends of Sun in this ch art. Saturn is the only temporary 
enemy. 
 
Moon : Moon is in Cn. The 2 
nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 10 th , 11 th  and 12 th  rasis counted from Cn are 
Le, Vi, Li, Ar, Ta and Ge. Planets in those rasis a re Saturn, Sun and Mercury. They 
are temporary friends of Moon in this chart. Tempor ary enemies are Mars, Jupiter, 
Venus.

 38 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Exercise 5:  Consider Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1 and find the 
temporary friends and temporary enemies of Jupiter and Venus. 
 
Note that Moon and Jupiter have the same temporary friends and temporary enemies. 
That is because they occupy the same rasi and tempo rary relationships are based on 
the rasis occupied by planets. 
 
3.4.3  Compound Relationships 
 
We get the compound relationships between planets b y combining permanent and 
temporary relationships as shown in Table 8.  
 
Table 8: Compound Relationships 
 Temporary friend Temporary enemy 
Natural friend Adhimitra (good friend) Sama (neutral) 
Natural neutral Mitra (friend) Satru (enemy) 
Natural enemy Sama (neutral) Adhisatru (bad enemy) 
 
Example 5: Let us continue from Example 4 and find the friends and enemies of Sun 
and Moon in Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1. 
 
Sun : We found in Example 4 that Sun’s temporary friend s are Mercury, Moon, 
Jupiter, Mars and Venus. Of these, Moon, Mars and J upiter are natural friends and 
they become adhimitras (good friends). Mercury is a  neutral planet in natural 
relationship and he becomes a mitra (friend) in com pound relationship. Venus is a 
natural enemy. Being a temporary friend, Venus beco mes a sama (neutral) planet in 
compound relationship. 
 
Saturn is the only temporary enemy of Sun. Being a natural enemy too, he becomes 
an adhisatru (bad enemy) of Sun. 
 
Moon : We found in Example 4 that Moon’s temporary frien ds are Sun, Mercury and 
Saturn. Of these, Sun and Mercury are natural frien ds and they become adhimitras 
(good friends). Saturn is a neutral in natural rela tionship and he becomes a mitra 
(friend) in compound relationship. 
 

--- Page 51 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 39 
 
 
 
Moon’s temporary enemies are Mars, Jupiter and Venu s. They are all natural 
neutrals and they become satru (enemies) in compound relationship. 
 
Exercise 6:  Continue from Exercise 5 and find the friends and enemies of Jupiter 
and Venus in Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1. 
 
Whenever we refer to a planet being in a friendly h ouse or an inimical house in the 
rest of this book, we mean the compound relationshi ps. A planet occupying a rasi 
owned by a mitra or adhimitra is in a friendly hous e. A planet occupying a rasi 
owned by a satru or adhisatru is in an inimical house.

4.  Upagrahas 
 
4.1  Introduction 
 
There are 11  upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites) defined by S age Parasara. They do 
not appear to correspond to any physical bodies (pl anets, stars etc ). From Sage 
Parasara's definition, they appear to be some signi ficant mathematical points. They 
will be defined in two groups. 
 
4.2  Sun-based Upagrahas 
 
Five upagrahas called Dhuma, Vyatipaata, Parivesha, Indrachaapa and Upaketu 
are defined based on Sun's longitude. The exact for mulas are given in Table 9. All 
these upagrahas are very malefic  in nature. Any houses occupied by them in rasi 
chart or divisional charts are spoiled by them. 
 
Table 9: Sun-based Upagrahas 
Upagraha Longitude Formula 
Dhuma Sun's longitude + 133 °20' 
Vyatipaata 360º – Dhuma’s longitude 
Parivesha Vyatipata's longitude + 180 ° 
Indrachaapa 360º – Parivesha’s longitude 
Upaketu Indrachaapa’s longitude + 16 °40' 
= Sun's longitude – 30 ° 
 
It may be noted that Dhuma and Indrachaapa are apar t by 180 ° and Vyatipaata and 
Parivesha are apart by 180 °. 
 
Example 6: 
Let us say Sun is at 9Sg36. Sg is the 9 
th  rasi and so Sun's longitude can be expressed 
as 8s 9 °36' (based on the notation introduced in 1.3.2). Th e length of each of the 8 

--- Page 54 ---
  
 
 42 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
rasis before Sg is 30 °. So we can find the longitude of Sun ( i.e. , distance traversed by 
Sun from the beginning of the zodiac) as 8 x30 °+9 °36' = 249 °36'. 
 
Adding 133 °20' to it, we get 382 °56'. This can be rewritten 
8 as 22 °56'. That is the 
longitude of Dhuma. So Dhuma is at 22 °56' in Ar. Because Dhuma and Indrachaapa 
are 180 ° apart, you can say without further computation tha t Indrachapa is in the 7 th  
sign from Ar, which is Li. His advancement from the start of Li is also 22 °56'. 
 
N
OTE : You can verify that Aries and Libra, Taurus and S corpio, Gemini and 
Sagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius , Virgo and Pisces are the signs 
that are 180 ° apart. So, if Dhuma is at 11 °36' from the start of Aquarius, Indrachapa 
will be at 11 °36' from the start of Leo. 
 
Vyatipata is obtained by subtracting Dhuma from 360 º. We see that 360º – 22 °56' = 
337 °4'. So Vyatipata is at 337 °4', i.e.  at 7 °4' from the start of Pi. Since Parivesha is at 
180º from Vyatipata, he is at 7 °4' in Vi. 
 
Exercise 7: If Sun is at 13 °19' from the start of Ta, find the positions of all  the five 
upagrahas defined so far. 
 
4.3  Other Upagrahas 
 
Six upagrahas called Kaala, Mrityu, Arthaprahaara, Yamaghantaka , Gulika and 
Maandi are more difficult to compute. Kaala is a malefic u pagraha similar to Sun. 
Mrityu is a malefic upagraha similar to Mars. Artha prahaara is similar to Mercury. 
Yamaghantaka is similar to Jupiter. Gulika and Maandi are similar to Saturn. 
 
A day starts at the time of sunrise and ends at the  time of sunset. A night starts at the 
time of sunset and ends at the time of next day’s s unrise. Depending on whether one 
is born during the day or the night, we divide the length of the day/night into 8 equal 
parts. 
                                                
 
8 When adding or subtracting longitudes, we should s ubtract 360 ° if we get more than 360 ° and we 
should add 360 ° if we get less than 0 °. Adding or subtracting 360 ° means going around the zodiac 
once and coming to the same position. We should fin ally reduce all longitudes to a value between 0 ° 
and 360 °, by adding or subtracting 360 ° as many times as needed.

Daytime births : The first part is ruled by the lord of weekday an d then we cover 
planets in the order of weekdays. The part after th e one ruled by Saturn is lord-less. 
After that, Sun’s part comes. For example, the firs t 1/8 
th  of the daytime on a 
Thursday is ruled by Jupiter. Next part is ruled by  Venus. The 3 rd  part is ruled by 
Saturn. The 4 th  part is lord-less. The 5 th  part is ruled by Sun. The 6 th  part is ruled by 
Moon. The 7 th  planet is ruled by Mars. The 8 th  part is ruled by Mercury.

Night time births : The first part is ruled by the 5 
th  planet from the lord of weekday 
and then we cover planets in the order of weekdays.  For example, the first 1/8 th  of a 
Thursday night is ruled by the 5 th  planet from Jupiter, i.e.  Moon (Jupiter, Venus, 
Saturn, Sun, Moon – that’s the 5 th  one). Next part is ruled by Mars. The 3 rd  part is 
ruled by Mercury. The 4 th  part is ruled by Jupiter. The 5 th  part is ruled by Venus. The 
6th  part is ruled by Saturn. The 7 th  planet is lord-less. The 8 th  part is ruled by Sun. 
 
Table 10 gives the list of the ruling planets of al l the eight parts of the daytime and 
night time on all weekdays. 

--- Page 56 ---
  
 
 44 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Once we divide the day/night of birth into 8 equal parts and identify the ruling 
planets of the 8 parts, we can find the longitudes of Kaala etc upagrahas using the 
following procedure: 
 
(1)  Kaala rises at the middle of Sun’s part 
9. In other words, we find the time at the 
middle of Sun’s part and find lagna rising then. That gives Kaala’s longitude. 
(2)  Mrityu rises at the middle of Mars’s part. 
(3)  Artha Praharaka rises at the middle of Mercury’s part. 
(4)  Yama Ghantaka rises at the middle of Jupiter’s part. 
(5)  Gulika rises at the middle of Saturn’s part. 
(6)  Maandi rises at the beginning of Saturn’s part. 
 
Suppose one is born on Thursday night and we want Y amaghantaka’s longitude in 
his chart. Suppose night starts at 6 pm and ends at 6 am on the next day. We see from 
the table that Jupiter rules the 4 
th  part of a Thursday night. Each part is 12/8 = 1.5 
hours. The 4 th  part starts 4.5 hours after sunset, i.e.  at 10:30 pm, and ends 1.5 hours 
later. So Jupiter’s part extends from 10:30 pm to m idnight. The middle point of this 
part is at 11:15 pm. We find lagna rising at 11:15 pm and that will be Yama 
Ghantaka’s longitude. 
 
4.4  Answer to Exercise 
 
Exercise 7: 
 
Dhuma: At 26 °39' from the start of Vi 
Vyatipaata: At 3 °21' from the start of Li 
Parivesha: At 3 °21' from the start of Ar 
Indrachaapa: At 26 °39' from the start of Pi 
Upaketu: At 19 °1' from the start of Sc` 
                                                
 
9 Some scholars suggest that Kaala rises at the beginning of Sun’s part. The same thing applies to 
others.

5.  Special Lagnas 
 
5.1  Introduction 
 
There are some special lagnas defined by Parasara. In this book, we will widely use 
Hora lagna and Ghati lagna and it is time to define them and other special lagnas. 
 
5.2  Bhaava Lagna 
 
Bhaava lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at the rate of 
one rasi per 2 hours . In the rest of this book, bhava lagna will be denoted by BL .
10  
 
If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, horalagna is at 6s 4 °47' 
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19 °47' at 7:00 am, at 7s 4 °47' at 8:00 am, 8s 4 °47' at 10:00 am and 
so on. Bhavalagna moves at the rate of 1 ° per 4 minutes ( i.e. , 15 ° per hour). 
 
The following method may be used for computing bhavalagna. 
 
(1)  Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2)  Find the difference between the birthtime (or the e vent time) and the sunrise time 
found in (1) above. Convert the difference into min utes. The result is the 
advancement of bhavalagna since sunrise, in degrees. 
(3)  Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 
multiples of 360 ° and reduce the number to the range 0 °–360 °. 
(4)  This is the longitude of bhavalagna (BL). 
 
Example 7: 
A gentleman was born at 7:23 pm. Sunrise at his bir thplace was at 6:37 am on his 
birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24 °17' in Capricorn. Let us find BL. 
 
(1)  19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=12 
x60 + 46 min = 766 min 
                                                 
10  BL is defined only for the sake of completeness. We will not use it in this book. 

--- Page 58 ---
  
 
 46 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(2)  Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270 °+24 °17'=294 °17'. Add 766 ° to it. The result is 
1060 °17'. Subtracting 360 ° twice, we get 340 °17'. So BL is at 10 °17' in Pisces. 
 
5.3  Hora Lagna 
 
Hora lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of  sunrise. It moves at the rate of one 
rasi per hora (hour) . In the rest of this book, horalagna will be denoted by HL .  
 
If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4 °47' then, horalagna is at 6s 4 °47' 
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19 °47' at 6:30 am, at 7s 4 °47' at 7:00 am, 8s 4 °47' at 8:00 am and so 
on. Horalagna moves at the rate of 1/2 ° per minute ( i.e. , 30 ° per hour). 
 
The following method may be used for computing horalagna. 
 
(1)  Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2)  Find the difference between the birthtime (or the e vent time) and the sunrise time 
found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes. 
(3)  Divide the number by 2. The result is the advanceme nt of horalagna since 
sunrise, in degrees. 
(4)  Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 
multiples of 360 ° and reduce the number to the range 0 °–360 °. 
(5)  This is the longitude of horalagna (HL). 
 
Example 8: 
A gentleman was born at 7:23 pm. Sunrise at his bir thplace was at 6:37 am on his 
birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24 °17' in Capricorn. Let us find HL. 
 
(1)  19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=12 
x60 + 46 min = 766 min 
(2)  766/2=383 
(3)  Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270 °+24 °17'=294 °17'. Add 383 ° to it. The result is 
677 °17'. Subtracting 360 °, we get 317 °17'. So HL is at 17 °17' in Aquarius. 
 
5.4  Ghati Lagna 
 

--- Page 59 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 47 
 
 
 
Ghati lagna is at the position of Sun at the time o f sunrise. It moves at the rate of one 
rasi per ghati (ghati=1/60 
th  of a day, i.e. , 24 minutes ). In the rest of this book, 
ghatilagna will be denoted by GL . Ghati lagna is also called “ghatika lagna”. 
 
If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4 °47' then, ghatilagna is at 6s 4 °47' 
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19 °47' at 6:12 am, at 7s 4 °47' at 6:24 am, 8s 4 °47' at 6:48 am and so 
on. Ghatilagna moves at the rate of 1 °15' per minute ( i.e. , 30 ° per 24 minutes). 
 
The following method may be used for computing ghatilagna. 
 
(1)  Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2)  Find the difference between the birthtime (or the e vent time) and the sunrise time 
found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes. 
(3)  Multiply the number by 5. Divide the result by 4. T he result is the advancement 
of ghatilagna since sunrise, in degrees. 
(4)  Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 
multiples of 360 ° and reduce the number to the range 0 °–360 °. 
(5)  This is the longitude of ghatilagna (GL). 
 
Example 9: 
Let us find GL for the data in Example 8. 
 
(1) 19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=766 min 
(2)  766 
x5/4=957.5 
(3)  Sun's longitude at sunrise is 294 °17'. Add 957 °30' to it. The result is 1251 °47'. 
Subtracting 360 ° three times, we get 171 °47'. So GL is at 21 °47' in Virgo. 
 
Exercise 8: 
A lady was born at 3:11:48 am (hr, min, sec) in the early hours of May 28, 1961. Sun 
was at 13 °1' in Taurus then. Sunrise was at 6:19:18 am on May  27, 1961 at her 
birthplace. At that time, Sun was at 12 °11' in Taurus. Find the longitudes of HL and 
GL in her chart. 
 
5.5  Comments 
 

--- Page 60 ---
  
 
 48 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(1)  If the birthtime changes by one minute, GL will cha nge by 1.25 ° ( i.e. , 1 °15'). 
This is quite large and it can cause some error in the position of GL in some 
divisional charts. So, ghati lagna is more sensitiv e to birthtime errors than 
normal lagna. When using GL in divisional charts, w e should keep this in mind 
and try to correct the birthtime based on known eve nts first. Wrong data 
produces wrong results. Our analysis can only be as good as our data! 
 
(2)  Some astrologers don't like dealing with it, but bi rthtime errors are a fact of life 
and we have to live with them. If we prefer to choo se methods that work in spite 
of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, we are ignoring a key fact – there are 
many people in this world who are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and 
yet lead significantly different lives. Still some people hide from this fact and 
stick to methods that give the same results to everyone born in a 15-minute or 
one-hour or two-hour period, because they don't hav e to deal with the 
complicated issue of birthtime errors then! But tha t's not the right approach – we 
should give importance to finer techniques. After a ll, Sage Parasara must have 
written about all these fine techniques only because he thought they were useful. 
 
(3)  Some people define sunrise as the time when the center of the visual disk 
representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e. , the time when lagna and Sun 
are exactly at the same longitude. Some other peopl e consider sunrise as the time 
when the upper tip of the visual disk representing Sun appears to be r ising on 
the eastern horizon, i.e. , the time when the first ray of Sun is seen. The l atter 
approach is recommended. 
 
Exercise 9: 
Suppose (just suppose) that a key event from the kn own past of the lady of Exercise 
8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16 °15' and 17 °30' in Virgo. Correct 
the given birthtime accordingly. 
 
5.6  Use of Special Lagnas 
 
Use of special lagnas will become clearer in future  chapters. For now, it will suffice 
to say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows power.

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 49 
 
 
 
In any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna s hows self, from the point of view 
of money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from the point of view of 
fame, power and authority. For example, when we tim e good and bad periods for a 
businessman, hora lagna may be very important. When  we time good and bad 
periods for a politician, ghati lagna may be very important. 
 
5.7  Sree Lagna 
 
In Sanskrit, the word “Sree” means wealth. It also means Lakshmi, wife of Lord 
Narayana and goddess of wealth. Sree Lagna will be denoted by SL in the rest of this 
book. Sree Lagna is important for prosperity. Its u se will be shown in the chapter on 
Sudasa. Computation of Sree Lagna will be explained for now. 
 
(1)  Find the constellation occupied by Moon. 
 
(2)  Find the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon. 
 
(3)  Find the same fraction of the zodiac (360 °). 
 
(4)  Add this amount to the longitude of lagna. Subtract  multiples of 360 ° if 
necessary. The resulting amount is the longitude of Sree Lagna (SL). 
 
Example 10: 
Let us take a native with Moon at 13 Li 06 and lagn a at 25 Vi 05. Moon’s longitude 
is 180 ° + 13 °6' = 193 °6'. Lagna’s longitude 150 °+25 °5' is 175 °5'. 
 
(1)  Moon is in Swathi constellation, which runs from 6 °40' to 20 °0' in Libra. 
 
(2)  Moon’s advancement in his constellation is 13 °6' – 6 °40' = 6 °26'. As fraction of 
the whole constellation, this is (6 °26')/(13 °20') = 386'/800' = 0.4825. 
 
(3)  The same fraction of the zodiac is 0.4825 x 360 ° = 173.7 ° = 173 °42'. 
 
(4)  Adding this amount to the longitude of lagna, we ge t 175 °5' + 173 °42' = 348 °47. 
This is the longitude of SL. So SL is in Pisces at 18 °47'.

 50 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Exercise 10: 
Suppose someone has Moon at 15 Le 29 and lagna at 1 4 Sc 19. Find the longitude of 
SL (Sree Lagna). 
 
Warning : There are some more special lagnas defined by Par asara, but they are 
beyond the scope of this book. We will restrict our selves to the ones defined in this 
book.

6.  Divisional Charts 
 
6.1  Divisions of A Rasi 
 
Each rasi has many divisions. Divisions of rasis ar e again mapped to rasis. For 
example, a rasi may be divided into 4 parts and eac h part may be mapped to a 
different rasi. Ar may be divided into 4 parts and the 4 parts may be mapped to Ar, 
Cn, Li and Cp. Then the 4 parts of Ta may be mapped  to Ta, Le, Sc and Aq. And so 
on. Like this, we may divide all rasis into 4 parts  and map the 4 parts to different 
rasis. We may also divide rasis to 9 parts and map each part into a rasi. We can have 
many different divisions.  
 
Sage Parasara  defined 16 different divisions of ra sis. Jaimini and Tajaka writers 
mentioned 4 more divisions. It is possible that Par asara also dealt with these 4 
special divisions in sections that are perhaps miss ing today. In addition, there are 
more higher and finer divisions that are normally not used. 
 
Based on the rasis occupied by planets in various d ivisions, “divisional charts” are 
drawn.  As we have seen before, we need to know the  rasis occupied by planets, 
upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas to draw any cha rt. In every division, we divide 
the rasi into different parts, find the part contai ning each planet and see the rasi to 
which that part is mapped. Then we place the planet  in that rasi in the chart 
corresponding to that division. We can draw a chart  for each division. A planet can 
occupy different rasis in different divisions. 
 
Chart of each division is called a divisional chart . Each divisional chart can be 
treated as a different chart and interpreted differ ently. Different aspects of life are 
seen in different divisional charts. Rasi chart is simply a special case of divisional 
charts. If we divide each rasi into just one part ( i.e.  in effect, no division), we get rasi 
chart. 
 
In the rest of this book, everything we describe wi ll be applicable to all divisional 
charts, unless we explicitly state a chart. We can apply all the principles to all the 
divisional charts, but we should see only specific matters in a divisional chart. The 

--- Page 64 ---
  
 
 52 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
list of matters to be seen in each divisional chart  will be given after the details of 
computation are presented. 
 
In this book, D- n will denote the divisional chart based on the n
th  division of rasis, 
i.e.  based on dividing rasis into n parts. 
 
6.2  Computing Divisional Charts 
 
We will explain the computation of 20 divisional ch arts in this section. Higher 
divisional charts like D-108 and D-150 and variatio ns in charts like D-2, D-3, D-8 
and D-11 will not be covered in this book. 
 
6.2.1  Rasi Chart (D-1) 
 
A simple example of divisions is rasi chart  itself. It is also called “ kshetra chakra ". 
It is denoted by D-1. Longitudes in the range 0 °-30 ° are mapped to Aries, 30 °-60 ° to 
Taurus and so on, as mentioned earlier. Using Table  1, we can find the rasi occupied 
by a body based on its longitude. By “body” here, we mean planets, upagrahas, lagna 
or special lagnas – basically a physical or a mathe matical point in the zodiac that has 
a longitude associated with it. 
 
6.2.2  Hora Chart (D-2) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 2 equal parts of 15 ° each. Bodies in the first 15 ° of odd rasis 
are in Sun’s hora. Bodies in the second 15 ° of odd rasis are in Moon’s hora. Bodies 
in the first 15 ° of even rasis are in Moon’s hora. Bodies in the se cond 15 ° of even 
rasis are in Sun’s hora. 
 
N
OTE : Though absolutely correct, the above is not quite complete. Proper use of hora 
chart  is beyond the scope of this book. So we will  ignore and not use hora chart in 
this book. 
 
6.2.3  Drekkana Chart (D-3) 
 

--- Page 65 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 53 
 
 
 
Each rasi is divided into 3 equal parts of 10 ° each. Bodies in the first 10 ° of a rasi are 
placed in drekkana chart in the same rasi. Bodies i n the middle 10 ° of a rasi are 
placed in drekkana chart in the 5 
th  from the rasi.  Bodies in the last 10 ° of a rasi are 
placed in drekkana chart in the 9 th  from the rasi. 
 
Example 11: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Gemini in rasi 
chart. Mercury is at 3 °. Jupiter is at 19 °. Venus is at 21 °. 
 
Then Mercury is in the first 10 ° (0 °-10 °), Jupiter is in the middle 10 ° (10 °-20 °) and 
Venus is in the last 10 ° (20 °-30 °). So Mercury is placed in Gemini itself in drekkan a 
chart; Jupiter is placed in Libra (5 
th  from Gemini) in drekkana chart; and, Venus is 
placed in Aquarius (9 th  from Gemini) in drekkana chart. 
 
6.2.4  Chaturthamsa Chart (D-4) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 4 equal parts of 7.5 ° each. Bodies in the first, second, third 
and fourth 7.5 ° arc of a rasi are in the 1 
st , 4 th , 7 th  and 10 th  from that rasi (respectively) 
in chaturthamsa. In other words, planets in 0 °-7.5 ° in a rasi go into 1 st  from that rasi; 
planets in 7.5 °-15 ° go into 4 th  from that rasi; planets in 15 °-22.5 ° go into the 7 th  from 
that rasi; and, planets in the 22.5 °-30 ° go into the 10 th  from that rasi. 
 
This chart is also known as Chaturamsa or Turyamsa . 
 
Example 12: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Taurus. Mercury 
is at 3 °, Jupiter is at 14 ° and Venus is at 23 °. 
 
Mercury is in 0 °-7.5 ° arc, i.e.  the first 7.5 ° arc, of Ta. So he is in Ta (1 
st  from Ta) in 
D-4. 
Jupiter is in 7.5 °-15 ° arc, i.e.  the second 7.5 ° arc, of Ta. So he is in Le (4 
th  from Ta) 
in D-4. 
Venus is in 22.5 °-30 ° arc, i.e.  the fourth 7.5 ° arc, of Ta. So he is in Aq (10 
th  from Ta) 
in D-4. 
 
6.2.5  Panchamsa Chart (D-5) 

--- Page 66 ---
  
 
 54 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Each rasi is divided into 5 equal parts of 6 ° each. Bodies in the 5 parts of an odd rasi 
go into Ar, Aq, Sg, Ge and Li (respectively). Bodie s in the 5 parts of an even rasi go 
into Ta, Vi, Pi, Cp and Sc (respectively). 
 
6.2.6  Shashthamsa Chart (D-6) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 6 equal parts of 5 ° each. Bodies in the 6 parts of a rasi go 
into the 6 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether the rasi is odd or even. 
 
Example 13: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 3 
rd  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 4 th  part of the rasi. Ge is an odd 
rasi and counting starts from Ar. The 3 rd  from Ar is Ge. So the 3 rd  part in Ge goes 
into Ge in D-6. On the other hand, Sc is an even rasi and counting starts from Li. The 
4th  from Li is Cp. So the 4 th  part of Sc goes into Cp in D-6. So Mercury is in G e and 
Jupiter is in Cp in D-6 for this example. 
 
6.2.7  Saptamsa Chart (D-7) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 7 equal parts of 4 ° 17' 8.57''. Bodies in the 1 
st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 
5th , 6 th  and 7 th  parts of a rasi go into the 7 rasis starting from the rasi itself, if it is an 
odd rasi, or starting from the 7 th  sign from it, if it is an even rasi. 
 
Example 14: Let us say Mercury is at 10 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Vi. We see 
that 10 ° is in the 3 
rd  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 5 th  part of the rasi. Because Ge is 
an odd rasi, the 3 rd  part in Ge goes into the 3 rd  from Ge, i.e.  Le. On the other hand, Vi 
is an even sign and counting starts from the 7 th  from it, i.e.  Pi. The 5 th  from Pi is Cn. 
So the 5 th  part of Vi goes into Cn. So Mercury is in Le and J upiter is in Cn in D-7 for 
this example. 
 
6.2.8  Ashtamsa Chart (D-8) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 8 equal parts of 3 ° 45' each. Bodies in the eight parts of a 
rasi go into the 8 rasis starting from Ar, Sg or Le , based on whether the rasi is a 
movable, fixed or dual sign. 
 

--- Page 67 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 55 
 
 
 
Example 15: Let us say Mercury is at 10 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 10 ° is in the 3 
rd  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 6 th  part of the rasi. Because Ge is 
a dual rasi, counting starts from Le. The 3 rd  from Le is Li. So the 3 rd  part in Ge goes 
into Li in D-8. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed si gn and counting starts from Sg. The 
6th  from Sg is Ta. So the 6 th  part of Sc goes into Ta in D-8. So Mercury is in L e and 
Jupiter is in Ta in D-8 for this example. 
 
6.2.9  Navamsa Chart (D-9) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 9 equal parts of 3 ° 20' each. Bodies in the 9 parts of a rasi 
go into the 9 rasis starting from Ar, Cp, Li or Cn, based on whether the rasi is a fiery, 
earthy, airy or watery sign. 
 
This chart is also known as Dharmamsa . It is the most popular chart after rasi chart 
and some astrologers simply refer to it as “Amsa” (division). 
 
Example 16: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 4 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 6 th  part of the rasi. Because Ge is 
an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 4 th  from Li is Cp. So the 4 th  part in Ge goes 
into Cp in D-9. On the other hand, Sc is a watery s ign and counting starts from Cn. 
The 6 th  from Cn is Sg. So the 6 th  part of Sc goes into Sg in D-9. So Mercury is in C p 
and Jupiter is in Sg in D-9 for this example. 
 
6.2.10  Dasamsa Chart (D-10) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 10 equal parts of 3 ° each. Bodies in the 10 parts of a rasi go 
into the 10 rasis starting from the rasi itself or the 9 
th  from it, based on whether the 
rasi is an odd or even sign. 
 
This chart is also known as Dasamaamsa or Karmamsa or Swargamsa . 
 
Example 17: Let us say Mercury is at 10 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 10 ° is in the 4 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 7 th  part of the rasi. Because Ge is 
an odd rasi, counting starts from Ge itself. The 4 th  from Ge is Vi. So the 4 th  part in 
Ge goes into Vi in D-10. On the other hand, Sc is a n even sign and counting starts 

--- Page 68 ---
  
 
 56 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
from the 9 th  from it, i.e. Cn. The 7 th  from Cn is Cp. So the 7 th  part of Sc goes into Cp 
in D-10. So Mercury is in Vi and Jupiter is in Cp in D-10 for this example. 
 
6.2.11  Rudramsa Chart (D-11) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 11 equal parts of 2 ° 43' 38'' each. Count rasis from Ar to the 
rasi being divided, in the zodiacal order. Count th e same number of rasis anti-
zodiacally 
11  from Ar. Bodies in the 11 parts of the rasi go int o the 11 rasis starting 
from the rasi found thus. 
 
This chart is also known as Ekadasamsa . 
 
Example 18: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 5 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 7 th  part of the rasi. In the case of 
Ge, it is the 3 rd  rasi from Ar. The 3 rd  rasi from Ar in the reverse order is Aq. So 
counting starts from the Aq. The 5 th  from Aq is Ge. So the 5 th  part in Ge goes into Ge 
in D-11. In the case of Sc, it is the 8 th  rasi from Ar. Counting the 8 th  rasi from Ar in 
the reverse order, we get Vi. So counting starts fr om Vi. The 7 th  from Vi is Pi. So the 
7th  part of Sc goes into Pi in D-11. So Mercury is in Ge and Jupiter is in Pi in D-11 
for this example. 
 
6.2.12  Dwadasamsa Chart (D-12) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 12 equal parts of 2 ° 30' each. Bodies in the 12 parts of a rasi 
go into the 12 rasis starting from the rasi itself. 
 
Example 19: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 5 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 8 th  part of the rasi. The 5 th  from 
Ge is Li. So the 5 th  part in Ge goes into Li in D-12. The 8 th  from Sc is Ge. So the 8 th  
part of Sc goes into Ge in D-12. So Mercury is in L i and Jupiter is in Ge in D-12 for 
this example. 
 
6.2.13  Shodasamsa Chart (D-16) 
                                                 
11  The zodiacal order is: Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, … 
The anti-zodiacal order is: Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg, … 

--- Page 69 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 57 
 
 
 
 
Each rasi is divided into 16 equal parts of 1 ° 52' 30'' each. Bodies in the 16 parts of a 
rasi go into the 16 rasis starting from Ar, Le and Sg, based on whether the rasi is 
movable, fixed or dual. When counting rasis from a given rasi, we go zodiacally. 
After going over the 12 rasis from a rasi, we get t he same rasi as the 13 
th  rasi. So the 
13 th , 14 th , 15 th  and 16 th  rasis from a rasi are simply the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd  and 4 th  rasis. 
 
This chart is also known as Kalamsa . 
 
Example 20: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 6 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 11 th  part of the rasi. Ge is a dual 
rasi and we start counting from Sg. The 6 th  from Sg is Ta. So the 6 th  part in Ge goes 
into Ta in D-16. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed s ign and we start counting from Le. 
The 11 th  from Le is Ge. So the 11 th  part of Sc goes into Ge in D-16. So Mercury is in 
Ta and Jupiter is in Ge in D-16 for this example. 
 
6.2.14  Vimsamsa Chart (D-20) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 20 equal parts of 1 ° 30' each. Bodies in the 20 parts of a rasi 
go into the 20 rasis starting from Ar, Sg and Le, b ased on whether the rasi is 
movable, fixed or dual. 
 
Example 21: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 8 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 13 th  part of the rasi. Because Ge 
is a dual rasi, we start counting from Le. The 8 th  from Le is Pi. So the 8 th  part in Ge 
goes into Pi in D-20. On the other hand, Sc is a fi xed sign and the counting starts 
from Sg. The 13 th  from Sg is Sg itself (13 th  = 1 st , after removing 12). So the 13 th  part 
of Sc goes into Sg in D-20. So Mercury is in Pi and  Jupiter is in Sg in D-20 for this 
example. 
 
6.2.15  Chaturvimsamsa Chart (D-24) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 24 equal parts of 1 ° 15' each. Bodies in the 24 parts of a rasi 
go into the 24 rasis starting from Le or Cn, based on whether the rasi is odd or even. 
 
This chart is also called Siddhamsa . 

--- Page 70 ---
  
 
 58 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Example 22: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 9 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 16 th  part of the rasi. Ge is an odd 
rasi and counting starts from Le. The 9 th  from Le is Ar. So the 9 th  part in Ge goes 
into Ar in D-24. On the other hand, Sc is an even r asi and counting starts from Cn. 
The 16 th  from Cn is Li (16 th  = 4 th , after removing 12). So the 16 th  part of Sc goes into 
Li in D-24. So Mercury is in Ar and Jupiter is in Li in D-24 for this example. 
 
6.2.16  Nakshatramsa Chart (D-27) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 27 equal parts of 1 ° 6' 40'' each. Bodies in the 27 parts of a 
rasi go into the 12 rasis starting from Ar, Cn, Li and Cp based on whether the rasi is 
a fiery, earthy, airy or watery rasi. 
 
This chart is also called Saptavimsamsa or  Bhamsa . 
 
Example 23: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 10 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 18 th  part of the rasi. Because 
Ge is an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 10 th  from Li is Le. So the 10 th  part in 
Ge goes into Le in D-27. On the other hand, Sc is a  watery sign and counting starts 
from Cp. The 18 th  from Cp is Ge (18 th  = 6 th , after removing 12). So the 18 th  part of 
Sc goes into Ge in D-27. So Mercury is in Le and Ju piter is in Ge in D-27 for this 
example. 
 
6.2.17  Trimsamsa Chart (D-30) 
 
D-30 positions of planets are computed based on the following rules: 
 
Odd Rasis 
: 
• Bodies in 0 °-5° in odd rasis are placed in Ar in D-30. 
• Bodies in 5 °-10 ° in odd rasis are placed in Aq in D-30. 
• Bodies in 10 °-18 ° in odd rasis are placed in Sg in D-30. 
• Bodies in 18 °-25 ° in odd rasis are placed in Ge in D-30. 
• Bodies in 25 °-30 ° in odd rasis are placed in Li in D-30. 
 
Even Rasis 
: 

--- Page 71 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 59 
 
 
 
• Bodies in 0 °-5° in even rasis are placed in Ta in D-30. 
• Bodies in 5 °-12 ° in even rasis are placed in Vi in D-30. 
• Bodies in 12 °-20 ° in even rasis are placed in Pi in D-30. 
• Bodies in 20 °-25 ° in even rasis are placed in Cp in D-30. 
• Bodies in 25 °-30 ° in even rasis are placed in Sc in D-30. 
 
6.2.18  Khavedamsa Chart (D-40) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 40 equal parts of 45' each. Bodies in the 40 parts of a rasi go 
into the 40 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether the rasi is odd or even. 
 
This chart is also called Chatvarimsamsa . 
 
Example 24: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 15 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 26 th  part of the rasi. Because 
Ge is an odd rasi, counting starts from Ar. The 15 th  from Ar is Ge (15 th  = 3 rd , after 
removing 12). So the 15 th  part in Ge goes into Ge in D-40. On the other hand , Sc is 
an even rasi and counting starts from Li. The 26 th  from Li is Sc (26 th  = 2 nd , after 
removing multiples of 12). So the 26 th  part of Sc goes into Sc in D-40. So Mercury is 
in Ge and Jupiter is in Sc in D-40 for this example. 
 
6.2.19  Akshavedamsa Chart (D-45) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 45 equal parts of 40' each. Bodies in the 45 parts of a rasi go 
into the 45 rasis starting from Ar, Le or Sg, based  on whether the rasi is a movable, 
fixed or dual rasi. 
 
This chart is also called Pancha-chatvarimsamsa . 
 
Example 25: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19 ° in Sc. We see 
that 11 ° is in the 17 
th  part of the rasi and 19 ° is in the 29 th  part of the rasi. Because 
Ge is a dual rasi, we start counting from Sg. The 1 7 th  from Sg is Ar (17 th  = 5 th , after 
removing 12). So the 17 th  part in Ge goes into Ar in D-45. On the other hand , Sc is a 
fixed rasi and counting starts from Le. The 29 th  from Le is Sg. So the 29 th  part of Sc 

--- Page 72 ---
  
 
 60 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
goes into Sg in D-45. So Mercury is in Ar and Jupit er is in Sg in D-45 for this 
example. 
 
6.2.20  Shashtyamsa Chart (D-60) 
 
Each rasi is divided into 60 equal parts of 30' each. Bodies in the 60 parts of a rasi go 
into the 60 rasis starting the rasi itself. 
 
To see the part occupied by a body, we can take its  longitude from the beginning of 
the occupied rasi, multiply it by 2, take degrees and ignore minutes, add 1 to it. 
 
Example 26: Let us say Jupiter is at 222 ° 58' , i.e. 12 ° 58' in Scorpio. Multiplying 
12 ° 58' by 2, we get 25 ° 56'. Taking degrees and ignoring minutes, we get 2 5. 
Adding 1, we get 26. So 12 ° 58' is in the 26 
th  part of rasi (where each part is 1/60 th  of 
rasi, i.e. 30'). So we have to count the 26 th  rasi from Sc. Removing multiples of 12 
from 26, we get 2. The 2 nd  rasi from Sc is Sg. So Jupiter is in Sg in D-60 in  this 
example.

6.4  Insights on Divisional Charts 
 
Divisional charts based on divisions between 1 and 12 operate in the physical plane . 
They show physical matters. Body, wealth, residence , wife, children, parents – these 
are all matters relating to the physical self. 
 
Divisional charts based on divisions between 13 and  24 ( i.e.  D-16, D-20 and D-24) 
operate in the mental plane . They show matters that exist at the mental plane.  Sense 
of pleasure and unhappiness, religiousness, learnin g and knowledge – these are all 
matters relating to the mind and intellect. 
 
Divisional charts based on divisions between 25 and  36 ( i.e.  D-27 and D-30) operate 
in the plane of sub-consciousness . One’s strengths, weaknesses, inherent nature, 
evils, certain psychological imbalances – these are  all matters relating to the sub-
conscious self. 
 
Divisional charts based on divisions above 36 ( i.e.  D-40, D-45 and D-60) operate in 
a kaarmic plane of existence that is above physical self, mind and sub-conscious 
self. Based on the karma from previous lives, we all have an existence at a level that 
goes beyond the levels of body, mind and sub-consci ousness. Existence at that level 

--- Page 74 ---
  
 
 62 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
has a considerable role in deciding the pattern of one’s life, along with existence at 
the physical, mental and sub-conscious levels. High er divisional charts like D-40, D-
45 and D-60 throw light on this subtle aspect of chart analysis. 12  
 
6.5  Using Divisional Charts 
 
It is very important to memorize Table 11. We shoul d choose the divisional chart to 
analyze, based on the matter we are interested in. If we want to know something 
about one’s career, for example, we should analyze one’s dasamsa chart (D-10). If 
we want to know something about one’s luxuries and pleasures, we should analyze 
one’s shodasamsa (D-16). Based on the matter of int erest, we decide which area of 
life is relevant and analyze the corresponding divisional chart. 
 
We should remember which planets, rasis and houses show a particular matter and 
find links between them in the divisional chart of interest. 
 
Suppose we want to see when one would go abroad. It  is related to residence and 
fortune and we should analyze one’s chaturthamsa (D -4). The 9 
th  and 12 th  houses 
show foreign residence. Rahu signifies foreign resi dence. We should now look for 
links. If 12 th  lord is with Rahu in the 9 th  house in D-4, it can suggest that one would 
live abroad, probably during the periods of Rahu or 12 th  lord or 9 th  house. 
 
Suppose we want to see when one would get a promotion at the office. Because D-10 
shows one’s career and achievements, we should anal yze D-10. Because GL (ghati 
lagna) shows power and authority, planets or rasis giving a promotion are usually 
connected with GL. They are in GL or aspect GL. Bec ause AL shows status, planets 
associating with AL or the5th or the 10 
th  from it are favorable. If the lord of AL is in 
the 10 th  from it and aspects GL, probably his period will give a promotion. 
 
In this manner, we should analyze the divisional ch art that signifies the sphere of life 
that we are interested in and analyze the houses th at show the matter of interest. This 
is the key to correct chart analysis. We will see m any examples of this in coming 
chapters. 
                                                
 
12  The content of this paragraph has philosophical un dercurrents that may be difficult to understand 
for students without a good background in Hindu phi losophy. This knowledge should be learnt 
directly from a competent guru. Readers are advised to leave these higher charts until they find one.

6.6  Varga Grouping and Amsabala 
 
We have several varga groups, i.e.  groups of divisional charts. 
 
If a planet is in its moolatrikona or an own rasi o r its rasi of exaltation in a chart, it 
makes the planet very strong in that chart. In each  group of divisional charts, we can 
count the divisional charts in which a planet occupies its moolatrikona or an own rasi 
or its rasi of exaltation. Based on the count of su ch good divisional charts for the 
planet, we say that the planet is in a particular a msa (the higher this number is, the 
stronger the planet is). 
 
6.6.1  Shadvarga 
 
“Shadvarga” literally means “six divisions”. Shadva rga is a group of the following 
divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-9, (5) D-12, and, (6) D-30. 
 
The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the co rresponding count of divisional 
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies  its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation 
or an own rasi is listed below: 
 
Kimsukaamsa – 2, Vyanjanaamsa – 3, Chaamaraamsa – 4 , Chatraamsa – 5, 
Kundalaamsa – 6. 
 
6.6.2  Sapta varga 
 
“Sapta varga” literally means “seven divisions”. Sa pta varga is a group of the 
following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D- 2, (3) D-3, (4) D-7, (5) D-9, (6) D-
12, and, (7) D-30. 
 
The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the co rresponding count of divisional 
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies  its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation 
or an own rasi is listed below: 
 
Kimsukaamsa – 2, Vyanjanaamsa – 3, Chaamaraamsa – 4 , Chatraamsa – 5, 
Kundalaamsa – 6, Mukutaamsa – 7. 

--- Page 76 ---
  
 
 64 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
6.6.3  Dasa varga 
 
“Dasa varga” literally means “ten divisions”. Dasa varga is a group of the following 
divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3 , (4) D-7, (5) D-9, (6) D-10, (7) D-
12, (8) D-16, (9) D-30, and, (10) D-60. 
 
The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the co rresponding count of divisional 
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies  its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation 
or an own rasi is listed below: 
 
Paarijaataamsa – 2, Uttamaamsa – 3, Gopuraamsa– 4, Simhaasanaamsa – 5, 
Paaraavataamsa – 6, Devalokaamsa – 7, Brahmalokamsa  – 8, Airaavataamsa – 9, 
Sreedhaamaamsa – 10. 
 
N
OTE : This group is very important and some yogas – spe cial combinations – make 
use of these amsas. For example, lagna lord or ghat i lagna lord in Simhaasanaamsa 
would make one very famous. A quadrant lord with go od amsabala in dasavarga 
makes one very successful. Readers should memorize the above amsas. 
 
6.6.4  Shodasa varga 
 
“Shodasa varga” literally means “sixteen divisions” . Shodasa varga is a group of the 
following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D- 2, (3) D-3, (4) D-4, (5) D-7, (6) D-
9, (7) D-10, (8) D-12, (9) D-16, (10) D-20, (11) D- 24, (12) D-27, (13) D-30, (14) D-
40, (15) D-45, and, (16) D-60. 
 
The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the co rresponding count of divisional 
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies  its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation 
or an own rasi is listed below: 
 
Bhedakaamsa – 2, Kusumaamsa – 3, Nagapurushaamsa – 4, Kandukaamsa – 5, 
Keralaamsa – 6, Kalpavrikshaamsa – 7, Chandanavanaamsa – 8, Poornachandraamsa 
– 9, Uchchaisravaamsa – 10, Dhanvantaryamsa – 11, S ooryakaantaamsa – 12, 
Vidrumaamsa – 13, Indraasanaamsa – 14, Golokaamsa –  15, Sree Vallabhaamsa – 
16.

Example 27:  Let us look at the chart of Bill Cosby. He is a fa mous TV and film 
actor in USA. He is one of the greatest theatrical personalities of the world and a 
natural actor. He is known as a charitable person w ho donated huge amounts of 
money for the education of African American kids. H is birthdata is: 12 
th  July 1937, 
12:30 am (Time Zone: 5:00 west of GMT), 75 W 10, 39 N 57. 
 
The 9 
th  house shows charitable nature and the 12 th  house shows expenditure. Jupiter 
owns the 9 th  and 12 th  houses and occupies the 9 th  house here. This may be the reason 
for Mr. Cosby’s charitable nature. Let us see the amsabala of Jupiter. Jupiter is at 29 ° 
49' in Sg. The signs occupied by him in various charts are shown below: 
 
Rasi:  Sg, D-2:  Cn, D-3:  Li, D-4:  Vi, D-7:  Ge, D-9:  Sg, D-10:  Vi, D-12:  Sc, D-16:  
Pi, D-20:  Pi, D-24:  Cn, D-27:  Ge, D-30:  Li, D-40:  Cn, D-45:  Le, D-60:  Sc. 
 
Jupiter owns Sg and Pi. His moolatrikona is Sg. He is exalted in Cn. So we have to 
count the charts in which he is in Cn, Sg or Pi. 
 
(1)  Out of the 6 divisional charts of shadvarga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 3 charts –
Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa . 
(2)  Out of the 7 divisional charts of sapta varga, Jupi ter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 3 charts 
–Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa . 
(3)  Out of the 10 divisional charts of dasa varga, Jupi ter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 4 charts 
–Rasi, D-2,  D-9 and D-16. So Jupiter is in Gopuraamsa . 
(4)  Out of the 16 divisional charts of shodasa varga, J upiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 7 
charts –Rasi, D-2, D-9, D-16, D-20, D-24 and D-40. So Jupiter is in 
Kalpavrikshaamsa . 
 
Being in Gopuramsa and Kalpavrikshamsa makes Jupiter very strong. 
 
6.7  Conclusion 
 
The science of Vedic astrology stands on the basis of 4 pillars – grahas (planets), 
rasis (signs), vargas (divisional charts) and bhavas (houses). This chapter covered the 
third pillar – divisional charts. If readers have a n accurate software program that 

--- Page 78 ---
  
 
 66 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
gives all the divisional charts for any chart, it m ay be acceptable to ignore the details 
of computation. However, it is good to be aware of the details. 
 
For D-8 and D-11, there are different versions. For  D-2 and D-3 also, there are 
variations. Different variations of divisional char ts show different spheres of 
activities. However, we will ignore the variations in this book. 
 
Twenty divisional charts are covered here. Each div isional chart throws light on a 
specific sphere of activity. For example, D-10 show s career, D-9 shows marital life 
and D-7 shows the fortune of children. Choosing the  correct divisional chart for 
analyzing the matter of interest is the key to correct analysis.

7.  Houses 
 
7.1  Introduction 
 
The zodiac consists of 12 rasis. Each rasi is said to form a house. When we talk 
about houses, we always have a point of reference. The rasi containing the point of 
reference is the 1 
st  house. The next rasi is the 2 nd  house. The rasi after that is the 3 rd  
house. Suppose Moon is in Aquarius and suppose we w ant houses with respect to 
Moon. Then Aquarius is the 1 st  house, Pisces is the 2 nd  house, Aries is the 3 rd  house, 
Taurus is the 4 th  house and so on. As we go around the zodiac, we re ach Capricorn 
when we find the 12 th  house. 
 
In the same chart, Sun may be in Taurus. When we fi nd houses with respect to Sun, 
Taurus contains the 1 
st  house, Gemini contains the 2 nd  house, Cancer contains the 3 rd  
house and so on. If Ghati Lagna is in Virgo in the same chart, then the 1 st , 2 nd  and 3 rd  
houses with respect to Ghati Lagna are in Virgo, Libra and Scorpio respectively. 
 
Thus we can find houses with respect to different r eferences. The same sign may 
contain the 2 
nd  house with respect to one reference and the 6 th  house with respect to 
another reference. If we mention houses without cle arly specifying the reference 
used, it means that the reference used is lagna (as cendant). Lagna is the default 
reference when finding houses. 
 
Different houses stand for different matters. The m atters signified by a house also 
depend on the reference used. Each reference throws  light on matters of a specific 
nature and that colors the meaning of a house. For example, the 11 
th  house from 
lagna may stand for something and the 11 th  house from arudha lagna may stand for 
something else. It depends on the kind of matters s hown by the two references – 
lagna and arudha lagna. 
 
In addition, the matters signified by a house depen d on the divisional chart in which 
we are finding houses. Each divisional chart throws  light on matters of a specific 
nature. Again, that colors the meaning of a house. The 4 
th  house from lagna in D-16 
may mean something and the 4 th  house from lagna in D-24 may mean something 

--- Page 80 ---
  
 
 68 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
else. We have already listed the areas of life seen  from various divisional charts in 
the chapter on “Divisional Charts”. 
 
7.2  Significations of Houses 
 
The matters signified by various houses are listed below. For further discussion on 
the results of various houses, readers may refer ei ther to the ancient classics or to the 
modern classic – “How to Judge a Horoscope” (Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. Raman. 
 
First House:  Physical body, complexion, appearance, head, intel ligence, strength, 
energy, fame, success, nature of birth, caste. 
Second House:  Wealth, assets, family, speech, eyes, mouth, face, voice, food. 
Third House:  Younger co-borns, confidants, courage, mental stre ngth, 
communication skills, creativity, throat, ears, arm s, father’s death (7 
th  from 9 th ), 
expenditure on vehicles and house (12 th  from 4 th ), travels. 
Fourth House:  Mother, vehicles, house, lands, immovable property , motherland, 
childhood, wealth from real estate, education, rela tives, happiness, comforts, 
pleasures, peace, state of mind, heart. 
Fifth House:  Children, poorvapunya (good deeds of previous live s), intelligence, 
knowledge & scholarship, devotion, mantras (prayers ), stomach, digestive system, 
authority/power, fame, love, affection, emotions, judgment, speculation. 
Sixth House:  Enemies, service, servants, relatives, mental tens ion, injuries, health, 
diseases, agriculture, accidents, mental affliction, mother’s younger brother, hips. 
Seventh House:  Marriage, marital life, life partner, sex, passion  (and related 
happiness), long journeys, partners, business, deat h, the portion of the body below 
the navel. 
Eighth House:  Longevity, debts, disease, ill-fame, inheritance, loss of friends, 
occult studies, evils, gifts, unearned wealth, windfall, disgrace, secrets, genitals. 
Ninth House:  Father, teacher, boss, fortune, religiousness, spi rituality, God, higher 
studies & high knowledge, fortune in a foreign land , foreign trips, diksha (joining a

religious order), past life and the cause of birth,  grandchildren, principles, dharma, 
intuition, compassion, sympathy, leadership, charity, thighs. 
Tenth House:  Growth, profession, career, karma (action), conduc t in society, fame, 
honors, awards, self-respect, dignity, knees. 
Eleventh House:  Elder co-borns, income, gains, realization of hope s, friends, 
ankles. 
Twelfth House:  Losses, expenditure, punishment, imprisonment, hos pitalization, 
pleasures in bed, misfortune, bad habits, sleep, me ditation, donation, secret enemies, 
heaven, left eye, feet, residence away from the pla ce of birth, moksha 
(emancipation/liberation). 
 
We can find houses from houses and concatenate the meanings in some places. For 
example, the 3 
rd  house shows younger brother. The 2 nd  house from the 3 rd  house  is 
the 4 th  house (count 1, 2 from 3 rd  and get 3 rd , 4 th ). So the 4 th  house shows the wealth, 
speech etc of younger brother. The 7 th  house from the 3 rd  house is the 9 th  house and it 
can show younger sibling’s spouse. The 11 th  house from lagna shows friends and the 
4th  house from lagna is nothing but the 6 th  house from the 11 th  house. So the 4 th  house 
stands for enemies, diseases and debts of friends. In this manner, we can deduce 
many additional meanings of various houses. 
 
7.3  Common References for Houses 
 
It may be noted from the list above that each house  shows many matters. It may be 
confusing at first to pick the right meaning that i s relevant in a particular analysis. It 
becomes easier with experience. We have to note the  area of life seen in the 
divisional chart under examination. We have to choo se the meanings of houses that 
are relevant in that area of life. For example, the  4 
th  house shows education, vehicle, 
house and mother (among other things). A list of th e areas of life seen in various 
divisional charts is given in the chapter on “Divis ional Charts”. We see from it that 
learning is seen from D-24, pleasures and comforts from D-16, house and 
immovable property from D-4 and parents from D-12. So the 4 th  houses in D-24, D-
16, D-4 and D-12 show education, vehicle, house and mother (respectively). 
 

--- Page 82 ---
  
 
 70 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
We should also take cognisance of the kind of matte rs shown by various references 
and interpret the meaning of a house accordingly. T he 4 th house from lagna, the 4 th  
house from arudha lagna and the 4 th  house from paaka lagna can mean different 
things, depending on the matters shown by lagna, ar udha lagna and paaka lagna. 
Now we will learn about the most common references used in finding houses and the 
matters shown by them. 
 
Depending on the matter we are analyzing, we should  look at the correct divisional 
chart, the correct reference and the correct house.  Then only good results can be 
obtained. All this complexity may be perplexing to new students. However, there is 
something we should realize. Human existence is a v ery complicated thing and it is 
silly  and unscientific to expect a simplistic model for the complicated human life. 
Though Vedic astrology has too many parameters used  in chart analysis, they are all 
important as they give us the degrees of freedom ne cessary for modeling something 
as complicated as human life. However, if we do not  understand what each 
parameter means and end up using them in a mixed-up  way, we will get nowhere. So 
readers should strive to understand these basics very clearly. 
 
7.3.1  Lagna 
 
Lagna is the most commonly used reference when find ing houses. If no reference is 
mentioned when houses are listed, it means that lag na – the default reference – was 
used. Lagna shows true self. If we are trying to un derstand someone’s status in 
society, lagna may not be the correct reference. St atus does not relate to “true self”. 
It is a part of the illusion of this world. However , if we are trying to understand 
someone’s intentions in doing something or someone’ s knowledge or someone’s 
persistence, it relates to “true self”. So they are  seen from the houses counted from 
lagna. Lagna shows true self. It shows the overall spirit of “I” (self). 
 
7.3.2  Chandra Lagna (Moon lagna) 
 
Chandra lagna means Moon taken as a reference. We c an find houses from Moon. 
Because Moon is the significator of mind, these hou ses show things from the 
perspective of mind. For example, someone may be wo rking in a routine job, but he 
may have an active and enterprising mind and he may  be using it in his career. In 
that case, the 10 
th  house (career) from lagna may have the influence o f Saturn 

--- Page 83 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 71 
 
 
 
(routine job) and the 10 
th  house from Moon may have the influence of Mars (ac tive 
and enterprising). 
 
Houses counted from Moon are useful in looking at t hings from the point of view of 
mind. When we judge how happy one is, how ambitious  one is and how one views 
one’s career, the role of mind is paramount. So Chandra lagna should not be ignored. 
 
7.3.3  Ravi Lagna (Sun lagna) 
 
Ravi lagna means Sun taken as a reference. We can f ind houses from Sun. Because 
Sun is the significator of soul, these houses show things from the perspective of soul. 
For things related to physical vitality also, Sun is an important reference. 
 
7.3.4  Arudha Lagna 
 
Computation of arudha lagna (AL) will be explained in the chapter on “Arudha 
Padas”. For now, the readers should remember that a rudha lagna shows how a native 
is perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a native. 
 
A planet in the 10 
th  house from lagna may give some important developme nts in 
one’s profession. A planet in the 10 th  house from Chandra lagna may give some 
important mental activity in one’s profession. A pl anet in the 10 th  house from arudha 
lagna may give some important developments in one’s professional status. 
 
7.3.5  Paaka Lagna 
 
Paaka lagna is important when analyzing the natal c hart, dasas and transits. Paaka 
lagna is nothing but lagna lord taken as a reference. If someone with Pisces lagna has 
Jupiter in Cancer, then Cancer becomes paaka lagna.  If someone with Leo lagna has 
Sun in Virgo, Virgo becomes paaka lagna. 
 
Rasis represent situations and forces influencing t he course of a native’s life and 
planets represent individual beings. Lagna lord rep resents the physical self of a 
native. So that is what paaka lagna shows. Houses c ounted from paaka lagna throw 
light on matters related to the physical self of a native. 
 

--- Page 84 ---
  
 
 72 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Lagna shows the concept of self and it deals with one’s true personality . The 
physical existence of the person is different from this conceptual sel f. This applies to 
all divisional charts. Let us take an example. The 5 th  house shows scholarship, 
memory and success in competition. All these are re lated to learning and they are 
seen in D-24, the chart of learning. But they are better seen from different references. 
Let us find the best reference for each. 
 
Success in competition is related to the illusions and perceptions of the world and so 
the most appropriate reference is arudha lagna. The  5 
th  house from arudha lagna 
shows success in competition. Scholarship is not a measurable attribute of the 
physical existence. It is a property of one’s true personality and one’s conceptual 
self. So the 5 th  from lagna shows scholarship. If we take the self that exists 
physically and take its part as applicable to the a rea of life shown by D-24 ( i.e.  
learning), memory is a direct attribute of that self. Memory is a property of one’s self 
that physically exists. So the 5 th  house from paaka lagna shows memory the best. 
 
Saturn’s transit 
13  over the rasi containing one’s lagna may throw obs tructions and 
hamper one’s activities. Saturn’s transit over the rasi containing one’s Chandra lagna 
may create frustration and mental depression. Satur n’s transit over the rasi 
containing one’s paaka lagna may leave one feeling sick all the time and attack the 
physical vitality. 
 
7.3.6  Karakamsa Lagna 
 
Atma karaka stands for the soul of the person. Atma  karaka is an important reference 
point in a chart. Because the soul is an important factor in deciding the nature of 
inner self than the physical existence, atma karaka  is an important reference point in 
navamsa chart. Navamsa chart throws light on the in ner self and the rasi occupied by 
atma karaka in it is called “Karakamsa”. We can ana lyze navamsa chart with respect 
to Karakamsa. The 12 
th  house from Karakamsa shows the liberation of the s oul and 
the situation of Ketu there is conducive to moksha.  Propitiation of the deities 
corresponding to the strongest planet in the 12 th  house in navamsa from Karakamsa 
lagna can take one’s soul towards moksha. 
                                                
 
13  If a planet occupies, on a given day, a particular  rasi, then it is said to “transit” in that sign on  that 
day. Transit positions refer to the positions of pl anets on a given day and natal positions refer to t he 
positions of planets at the time of one’s birth. Th is will be dealt with in detail in the part “Transi t 
Analysis”.

7.3.7  Ghati Lagna 
 
Ghati lagna (GL) shows self, from the point of view  of power, authority and fame. 
When we analyze promotions in career or political p ower of politicians, this 
reference is very important. 
 
7.3.8  Hora Lagna 
 
Hora lagna (HL) shows self, from the point of view of wealth. This reference is 
important when analyzing one’s wealth. 
 
7.3.9  Graha Lagnas 
 
Apart from the above references, we use several “gr aha lagnas” or planetary 
references. For each house, a planet works as the n atural significator. To see matters 
signified by a house, we can take the relevant plan et as the reference. The list of 
houses that can be seen from each planet is given in Table 12. 
 
Table 12: Houses signified by planets 
Planet Houses 
Sun 9 th , 10 th , 11 th  
Moon 4 th , 1 st , 2 nd , 11 th , 9 th  
Mars 3 rd  
Mercury 6 th  
Jupiter 5 th  
Venus 7 th  
Saturn 8 th , 12 th  
 
When we analyze courage or persistence or weapons o r younger brothers or the 
expenditure on house or the expenditure on car, we have to analyze the 3 
rd  house in 
the relevant divisional chart. In all those cases, we can see the 3 rd  house from lagna 
and the 3 rd  house from Mars and draw conclusions based on the strength of both. If 

--- Page 86 ---
  
 
 74 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Mars is stronger than lagna, then the 3 rd  house from Mars may be more important 
than the 3 rd  house from lagna. Similarly, we see the 4 th  from lagna and the 4 th  from 
Moon for mother. We see the 9 th  from Sun and the 9 th  from lagna for father. We see 
the 12 th  from lagna and the 12 th  from Saturn for losses. We see the 5 th  from lagna and 
the 5 th  from Jupiter for progeny. We see the 7 th  from lagna and the 7 th  from Venus 
for marriage. 
 
In addition to the above list, we can find a house with respect to the naisargika 
karaka (natural significator) who signifies the matter sho wn by a house. For 
example, Venus signifies vehicles. D-16 is the char t that shows vehicles and 
pleasures. So the 4 
th  from Venus in D-16 can show one’s happiness from v ehicles 
and other luxuries. As Mercury is the natural signi ficator of speech, the 2 nd  house 
from lagna and the 2 nd  house from Mercury show speech (in rasi, D-9 and D-27 14 ). A 
complete list of naisargika karakas of different ma tters can be found in the chapter 
on “Karakas”. 
 
7.4  Special Categories 
 
There are some special categories of houses: 
 
(1)  The 1 
st , 5 th  and 9 th  houses form a triangle and they are known as “kona s” or 
“trikonas” or “trines” . 
(2)  The 1 st , 4 th , 7 th  and 10 th  houses are called “kendras” or “quadrants” or “angles”. 
(3)  The 2 nd , 5 th , 8th  and 11 th  houses are called “panapharas”  or “succedants”. These 
are basically the quadrants from the 2 nd  house. 
(4)  The 3 rd , 6 th , 9 th  and 12 th  houses are called “apoklimas”  or “precedants”. These 
are basically the quadrants from the 3 rd  house. 
(5)  The 3 rd , 6 th , 10 th  and 11 th  houses are called “upachayas” . 
                                                 
14  Rasi chart shows the overall picture and the manif estation at the physical level. Navamsa shows 
basic skills and the way one interacts with others.  D-27 shows one’s strengths and weaknesses. All the  
three charts are important. One may have strong ben efics in the 2 nd  from lagna in rasi and navamsa 
charts, but malefics in the 2 nd  from Mercury in D-27. In such a case, one will be a skilled speaker, but 
harsh speech may be his weakness. D-27 throws light  on the sub-conscious self and shows one’s 
inherent strengths and weaknesses. 

--- Page 87 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 75 
 
 
 
(6)  The 6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  houses are called “trik sthanas” or “dusthanas” (bad/evil 
houses). 
(7)  The 4 th  and 8 th  houses are called “chaturasras” . 
 
We can find trines, quadrants etc  from lagna or other references or even from houses. 
We can find houses with respect to a reference and then find trines, quadrants etc  
with respect to those houses . For example, let us take the 3 
rd  house from lagna. 
Trines from it are the 1 st , 5 th  and 9 th  houses from it. The 5 th  house from the 3 rd  house 
is the 7 th  house (count 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 starting from the 3 rd  house. We get 3 rd , 4 th , 5 th , 
6th  and 7 th . So the 5 th  from 3 rd  is 7 th ). The 9 th  house from the 3 rd  house is the 11 th  
house. So 3 rd , 7 th  and 11 th  houses are the trines from the 3 rd  house. Similarly, the 3 rd , 
6th , 9 th  and 12 th  houses are the quadrants from the 3 rd  house. And the 5 th , 8 th , 12 th  and 
1st  houses are the upachayas from the 3 rd  house. The 8 th , 10 th  and 2 nd  houses are the 
dusthanas from the 3 rd  house. Thus we can find trines, quadrants etc  from any house. 
 
7.4.1  Trines 
 
Trines are the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, who rules prosperity. Trines from any 
reference are houses that are beneficial to the ref erence. They bring prosperity and 
well-being to the reference. For example, trines from lagna shows prosperity of self. 
 
In Hinduism, there are 4 purushaarthas (purposes/go als of man) – (1) Dharma : 
righteousness and adherence to one’s duty, (2) Artha : money and career, (3) Kaama : 
desiring things and getting them, and, (4) Moksha : final liberation of soul. 
 
Dharma is shown by the trines from the 1 
st  house – 1 st , 5 th  and 9 th  – and they show 
prosperity of self, intelligence and dharma 15 . They are called “dharma trikonas” 
(trines of duty). The character of a person, his in telligence and his righteousness 
decide how one follows dharma  – the first purpose of human existence. 
 
Trines from the 2 
nd  house are called “artha trikonas” (trines of money) and they show 
money related activities. The 2 nd  house shows wealth. The 6 th  house shows service. 
The 10 th house shows career and activities in society. Thes e three houses show 
money related activities and how one follows artha  – the second purpose of human 
existence. 
                                                
 
15  Dharma literally means duty. However, it has come to mean righteousness. 

--- Page 88 ---
  
 
 76 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Trines from the 3 
rd  house are called “kaama trikonas” (trines of desir e) and they 
show one’s desires and how one gets them. The 3 rd  house shows one’s persistence. 
The 7 th  house shows relations and sex. The 11 th  house shows gains. These three 
houses show how one follows kaama  – the third purpose of human existence. 
 
Trines from the 4 
th  house (4 th  – harmony, 8 th  – occult studies and spiritual awakening 
and 12 th  – moksha) are called “moksha trikonas” (trines of liberation) and they show 
how one follows moksha  – the fourth purpose of human existence. 
 
Digbala of planets who attain full digbala in vario us of these trines shows the 
strength of different purushaarthas in one’s life. Dasas like “Trikona Dasa” which are 
based on trines show how one follows the four purushaarthas in life. 
 
Planets in mutual trines 
16  make each other prosper. 
 
7.4.2  Quadrants 
 
Quadrants are the abode of Sri Maha Vishnu, the Sup reme Lord who sustains this 
universe as per Hinduism. Quadrants from any reference show its sustenance. The 1 
st  
house (self), 4 th  house (comforts), 7 th  house (marriage and relations with others) and 
the 10 th  house (profession) sustain each other. 
 
Planets in mutual quadrants 
17  have a sustaining effect on each other. 
 
7.4.3  Upachayas 
 
Upachayas from a reference show forces causing gain s and growth to the matters 
signified by the reference. For example, arudha lag na shows one’s status and the 
upachayas from arudha lagna show improvement of status. 
 
7.4.4  Dusthanas 
 
                                                
 
16  We say that two planets are in “mutual trines”, if one planet is in a trine from the other. 
17  We say that two planets are in “mutual quadrants”, if one planet is in a quadrant from the other. 

--- Page 89 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 77 
 
 
 
Dusthanas from a reference show forces causing setb acks to the matters signified by 
it. If a dusthana is fortified or afflicted by male fics, it may show serious obstacles. If 
a dusthana is weak, it shows that obstacles will be  easily overcome. For example, 
exalted 8 
th  lord may show a lot of troubles and debilitated 8 th  lord may show easy 
sailing. 
 
7.4.5  Visible Half and Invisible Half 
 
The zodiac is divided into two halves in every char t: The 7 
th , 8 th , 9 th , 10 th , 11 th  and 
12 th  houses form the “visible half” of the zodiac. The 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 5 th  and 6 th  
houses form the “invisible half” of the zodiac. The  houses in the visible half of the 
zodiac with respect to a reference give results tha t can be seen in the material world 
and the houses in the invisible half of the zodiac give results that cannot be easily 
seen. It is for this reason that the bases of dharm a trikona (1 st  house) and moksha 
trikona (4 th  house) are in the invisible half and the bases of artha trikona (10 th  house) 
and kaama trikona (7 th  house) are in the visible half. 
 
7.4.6  Quick Summary 
 
Trines :   Prosperity and flourishing 
Quadrants :  Sustenance and vital activity 
Upachayas :  Gains and growth 
Dusthanas :  Setbacks and obstacles

7.5  A Controversy 
 
Houses are found with respect to lagna, special lag nas and some planets. Houses are 
found in rasi chart and in all the divisional chart s. Some scholars ignore all these and 
take houses only with respect to lagna and only in rasi chart. They prepare something 
called “bhaava chakra” or “chalit chakra”, in which  houses can start in one rasi and 
end in another. They take lagna’s longitude to be t he mid-point of the first house and 
construct all the houses accordingly. In the “equal house method”, they take a 30º arc 
with center at lagna as the 1 
st  house. The next 30º arc is taken as the 2 nd  house and so 
                                                 
18  This will be covered in the chapter on “Aspects and Argalas”. 

--- Page 90 ---
  
 
 78 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
on. This method is popular among Indian astrologers . Another method taught by 
Sripathi is more complicated and it is also popular . However, this author 
recommends neither. Each rasi is a house. The rasi containing the reference point 
chosen is the 1 st  house and the next rasi is the 2 nd  house. 
 
Though there are some indirect  references in BPHS 
19  suggesting that Parasara 
supported house divisions placing houses in 2 rasis , there are quite a few direct  
references making it amply clear that each house fa lls in one rasi. Parasara taught us 
to find houses by counting rasis from the reference  chosen. Moreover, only this 
approach is logical as we go to divisional charts. Parasara’s treatment does not 
differentiate between rasi and divisional charts, as far as the basic techniques go. 
 
So readers are advised to ignore all the discussion s found in other textbooks on 
house division methods, “bhaava chakra” and “chalit  chakra”. It may do good to 
follow the instructions in this chapter. 
 
                                                
 
19  “Brihat Paaraasara Hora Saastram” is a classic by Sage Parasara. It is the most authentic  and final 
treatise on Vedic astrology. It was written more than 5,000 years ago.

8.  Karakas 
 
8.1  Introduction 
 
The word karaka 
 20  means “one who causes”. Karaka of a matter is the significator of 
the matter. He is the one who causes events related to that matter. 
 
There are 3 kinds of karakas: 
 
(1)  Naisargika karakas  ( natural  significators, 9 in number). 
(2)  Chara karakas  ( variable significators, 8 in number), and, 
(3)  Sthira karakas  ( fixed significators, 7 in number), 
 
One should not use the three types of karakas in a mixed-up way. Karakas of each 
type have a specific purpose. One should understand  the distinction between chara, 
sthira and naisargika karakas clearly and use them accordingly. 
 
Naisargika  karakas shows everything that exists in the creati on. They include Rahu, 
Ketu and the seven planets. They are presided by Brahma . Naisargika karakas show 
not only human beings, but they show various impers onal things and matters. They 
show everything that exists in Brahma’s creation an d affects a person. Naisargika 
karakas are very useful in phalita Jyotish, i.e.  analysis of general results. 
 
Chara  karakas include Rahu and the seven planets. They d o not include Ketu, as 
Ketu stands for moksha (emancipation) and does not stand for any person who 
affects one’s sustenance. Chara karakas are preside d by Vishnu  and they show 
people who play a role in one’s life. As Vishnu pre sides over activities related to 
sustenance, achievements and spiritual progress, ch ara karakas show these aspects of 
one’s life. Chara karakas show people who play an i mportant role in one’s 
sustenance and achievements. Examples are – mother,  father, wife, advisors etc . 
Chara karakas are very useful in Raja Yogas and in spiritual progress. They also 
show how our karma (cumulative sum of actions) is carried from one life to another. 
 
                                                
 
20  This is pronounced as “kaaraka”. 

--- Page 92 ---
  
 
 80 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Sthira  karakas include only 7 planets because only they h ave physical bodies. They 
are presided by Shiva . As Shiva presides over death 21 , they show the destruction of 
body. Sthira karakas are useful in timing the death of various near relatives. 
 
8.2  Chara Karakas 
 
We use the following procedure to find chara karakas: 
 
(1)  Take the eight planets – Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and 
Rahu. For each planet, find its advancement from th e beginning of the rasi 
occupied by it. For Rahu, measure the advancement from the end of his rasi. 
(2)  Arrange them in the decreasing order of advancement. 
(3)  The planet with the highest advancement is Atma Kar aka (significator of self). 
We will denote him by AK. Find other chara karakas using Table 13. 
Table 13: Chara karakas 
Advancement Order 
 Karaka Symbol Persons shown 22  
1 Atma Karaka AK Self 
2 Amatya Karaka AmK Ministers 23  
3 Bhratri Karaka BK Siblings 
Highest 
4 Matri Karaka MK Mother 
5 Pitri Karaka PiK Father 
6 Putra Karaka PK Children 
7 Jnaati 24  Karaka GK (JK) Rivals 25  
Lowest 8 Dara karaka DK Spouse 
 
If two planets have the same degrees, we should com pare minutes. If minutes are 
same, we should compare the seconds. If two planets  are exactly at the same 
longitude, then they will hold a karakatwa (signifi cation) together and the next 
                                                
 
21  In Indian philosophy, death is nothing but praana (life) becoming sthira  (fixed). 
22  PK can also show subordinates and followers. PiK can show a boss. 
23  In practical terms, this means people who give advice (advisors and counsellors). 
24  In the symbol “jn” here, ‘j’ is the voiced palatal  consonant and ‘n’ is the palatal nasal. This is a 
tough sound to pronounce correctly. Some people app roximate it as as “gnaati” or “gyaati”. 
25  This karaka is commonly used for enemies or rivals . However, the literal meaning of “jnaati” is 
“paternal cousin”. 

--- Page 93 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 81 
 
 
 
karakatwa will have no ruler. We should use the cor responding sthira karaka in that 
case. However, this rarely becomes necessary, as two planets are rarely at exactly the 
same longitude. 
 
Example 28:  Consider the following planetary position – Sun: 1 2Ge47, Moon: 
20Ar28, Mars: 13Ge51, Mercury: 25Ge18, Jupiter: 5Ta 40, Venus: 17Ge21, Saturn: 
2Ta28, Rahu: 1Cn43. Advancements of planets in resp ective rasis are found and 
arranged in the decreasing order in Table 14. Based on it, chara karakas are listed. 
 
Table 14: Chara karakas in Example 28 
Planet Advancement in rasi Order Chara karaka 
Rahu 30 ° – 1 °43' = 28 °17' 1 AK 
Mercury 25 °18' 2 AmK 
Moon 20 °28' 3 BK 
Venus 17 °21' 4 MK 
Mars 13 °51' 5 PiK 
Sun 12 °47' 6 PK 
Jupiter 5°40' 7 GK (JK) 
Venus 2°28' 8 DK 
 
So Rahu represents the self of the native for the p urpose of raja yogas, analysis of 
sustenance, achievements and spiritual evolution. A K throws light on the inner self 
of a native. Rahu can show a spiritually advanced p erson or a saint on one hand and 
a revolutionary or an outcast on the other. Mercury  represents the native’s advisors 
and he shows intellectuals when strong and indecisive people when weak. 
 
Exercise 11:  Consider the following planetary position – Sun: 9 Sg36, Moon: 
15Le29, Mars: 13Ar40, Mercury: 21Sc00, Jupiter: 2Aq 06, Venus: 17Sg42, Saturn: 
9Sc41, Rahu: 14Ge30. Find chara karakas. Guess the nature of the inner self of the 
native. 
 
8.3  Sthira Karakas 
 
The following is the list of sthira karakas: 

--- Page 94 ---
  
 
 82 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Sun or Venus (stronger) 
 26 : Father 
Moon or Mars (stronger) : Mother 
Mars : Younger siblings, brother-in-law and sister-in-law (spouses of siblings) 
Mercury : Maternal relatives (uncles and aunts) 
Jupiter : Husband, sons, paternal grandparents and other pa ternal relatives (uncles 
and aunts) 
Venus : Wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law & maternal grandparents 
Saturn : Elder siblings 
27  
 
The use of sthira karakas has already been explained. They are presided by Shiva and 
they are used in the timing of death of the above r elatives. They should not be used 
in general predictive astrology in the place of nai sargika karakas. For example, some 
astrologers use the 7 
th  from Jupiter instead of the 7 th  from Venus to predict marriage. 
However, Venus is the natural significator of marriage and the 7 th  from Venus should 
be used for predicting marriage, both in male and f emale charts. When predicting the 
death of spouse, we use Jupiter in female charts and Venus in male charts. 28  
 
Another difference between sthira and naisargika ka rakas is that sthira karakas 
themselves represent the physical bodies of the rel atives. In the case of naisargika 
karakas, we must take the relevant house from the k araka. For example, Jupiter 
represents the physical body of husband in a female  chart, for the purpose of timing 
death. For the purpose of timing marriage, the 7 
th  from Venus (and not Venus 
himself) shows husband. 
 
Chara karakas are also similar to sthira karakas in  this aspect. We do not take the 7 
th  
from DK for spouse, but DK himself shows spouse. 
 
8.4  Naisargika Karakas 
 
                                                
 
26  For methods to compare the strengths of planets, o ne may refer to the chapter “Strength of Planets 
and Rasis”. Some people opine that Sun should be ta ken as the fixed significator of father for daytime 
births and Venus for nighttime births. Similarly, Moon is taken as the fixed signi ficator of mother for 
nighttime births and Mars for daytime births. 
27  Some scholars give Saturn as the sthira karaka for children instead of elder siblings. 
28  Some scholars take Jupiter as the sthira karaka of spouse in male charts also. 

--- Page 95 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 83 
 
 
 
We have seen that chara karakas are used in analyzi ng the influences of various 
persons on a native, from the point of view of sust enance, achievements and spiritual 
evolution. We have seen that sthira karakas are use d in analyzing the death of 
relatives. In addition, we have naisargika karakas, who are the natural significators of 
various matters. These significations are used in g eneral Phalita Jyotish. Table 15 
gives a list of naisargika karakas. For example, th e 4 
th  house from Moon shows 
mother. The 5 th  house from Jupiter shows sons. If we want to analy ze the birth of 
children or analyze some simple events from their l ives, we should take the 5 th  from 
Jupiter. If we want to analyze some children-relate d troubles that punish one’s soul 
or if we want to analyze some achievements and happ iness related to children, they 
will be more closely related to PK (putra karaka of chara karakas). If we want to time 
the death of a child, sthira karaka for children (Jupiter) should be used.

In addition, we have various other matters allotted  to different planets in classics. 
The list of the natural significations of various p lanets is listed in Table 16. For 
example, Mercury and 5

shows memory.

Mercury is AK. Mercury shows intellectuals, orators , journalists, good 
communicators, people who can move with anyone, peo ple who are liked by 
everyone, and, fickle-minded people. The native can be one of these types.

9.  Arudha Padas 
 
9.1  Introduction 
 
Lagna shows true self. However, people’s perception s of a person can be different 
from reality. Usually, how one is perceived by othe rs is more important in material 
life than who one really is. A political leader per ceived by people as a powerful and 
influential person may in reality be a coward and a  confused man always in doubt. 
But the reality does not matter in deciding his mat erial life. Perceptions matter more. 
People perceive him as a strong leader and that mat ters the most in deciding his 
political career. 
 
A political leader generally perceived as an honest  man may in reality be badly 
corrupt. A person generally perceived as an intelli gent person may in reality be of 
average intelligence. An intelligent person may sco re poorly in examinations and 
people may not know his intelligence. 
 
If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering instit ute of India), people may think that 
he is very knowledgable. If someone studied at an o bscure university, people may 
not get the same impression. But it is possible tha t people’s perceptions are wrong 
and the person who studied at IIT is less knowledga ble. If an astrologer is frequented 
by a top politician, people may get an impression t hat the astrologer is good. If an 
astrologer maintains a low profile, people may thin k that he is average. But the latter 
astrologer may be more learned in reality. 
 
What people perceive about a person can often be di fferent from reality. However, 
perceptions and reality are both important to an as trologer. For predicting some 
matters, we need knowledge of the perceptions ( e.g.  success of a politician in 
elections, success in a competitive examination, pr omotion at office etc ). For 
predicting some internal matters, on the other hand , true self should be clearly 
understood. 
 
So we, astrologers, should be able to separate real ity from perceptions and 
understand both correctly. We should understand the  true nature of a person and also

how he is perceived by the world. Arudha padas are a very important concept of 
Vedic astrology and they help us with that tough, but important, task. 
 
9.2  Computation of Bhava Arudhas 
 
Arudha padas of all the 12 houses (bhavas) in all t he divisional charts are defined as 
follows: 
 
(1)  Take sign containing the house of interest in the divisional chart of interest. 
(2)  Find the sign occupied by the lord of that house. 
N
OTE : Aquarius is owned by Saturn and Rahu. Scorpio is ow ned 
by Mars and Ketu. Take the stronger lord in the cas e of houses 
falling in these two signs. The chapter on “Strengt h of Planets and 
Rasis” will explain the rules used in comparing the  strengths of 
planets. 
(3)  Count signs from the house of interest to the sign containing its lord. Counting is 
in the zodiacal direction always. For example, if t he house we are interested in is 
in Gemini and its lord Mercury is in Aquarius, we c ount signs from Gemini to 
Aquarius and get 9. 
(4)  Count the same number of signs from the sign contai ning the lord and find the 
ending sign. In the above example, we count 9 signs  from Aquarius and we end 
up in Libra. 
(5)  Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1 st  or 7 th  from the original 
sign in step (1), then we take the 10 th  sign from the sign found in step (4). 
Otherwise we don’t make any change. 
(6)  The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the house of interest. 
 
Arudha pada of a house is simply called arudha or p ada also. In this book, we will 
denote the arudha pada on n
th  house with A n. For example, arudha pada of 4 th  house 
is A4 and arudha pada of 9 th  house is A9. 
 
There are two special cases: Arudha pada of lagna i s denoted as AL (arudha lagna) 
and arudha pada of 12 
th  house is denoted as UL (upapada lagna).

Example 29: Consider Chart 1 and find the arudha padas of all the 12 houses.  
 
Chart 1 
 
 
(1)  First house is in Vi. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from Vi to Pi, 
we get a count of 7. Counting 7 signs from Pi, we g et Vi. However, this is in 
the 1 
st  from the original sign (Vi). So we take the 10 th  therefrom and get Ge. 
AL is in Ge. 
(2)  Second house is in Li. Lord is Venus and he is in P i. Counting from Li to Pi, 
we get a count of 6. Counting 6 signs from Pi, we get Le. A2 is in Le. 
(3)  Third house is in Sc. Lord is Mars – he is stronger  than Ketu, being with 2 
other planets – and he is in Ar. Counting from Sc t o Ar, we get a count of 6. 
Counting 6 signs from Ar, we get Vi. A3 is in Vi. 
(4)  Fourth house is in Sg. Lord is Jupiter and he is in  Ar. Counting from Sg to Ar, 
we get a count of 5. Counting 5 signs from Ar, we get Le. A4 is in Le. 
(5)  Fifth house is in Cp. Lord is Saturn and he is in A r. Counting from Cp to Ar, 
we get a count of 4. Counting 4 signs from Ar, we g et Cn. However, this is in 
the 7 th  from the original sign (Cp). So we take the 10 th  therefrom (from Cn) 
and get Ar. A5 is in Ar. 

--- Page 100 ---
  
 
 88 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(6)  Sixth house is in Aq. Lord is Saturn – he is strong er than Rahu, being with 2 
other planets – and he is in Ar. Counting from Aq t o Ar, we get a count of 3. 
Counting 3 signs from Ar, we get Ge. A6 is in Ge. 
(7)  Seventh house is in Pi. Lord is Jupiter and he is i n Ar. Counting from Pi to Ar, 
we get a count of 2. Counting 2 signs from Ar, we get Ta. A7 is in Ta. 
(8)  Eighth house is in Ar. Lord is Mars and he is in Ar . Counting from Ar to Ar, 
we get a count of 1. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we ge t Ar itself. However, this 
is in the 1 st  from the original sign (Ar). So we take the 10 th  therefrom and get 
Cp. A8 is in Cp. 
(9)  Ninth house is in Ta. Lord is Venus and he is in Pi . Counting from Ta to Pi, 
we get a count of 11. Counting 11 signs from Pi, we get Cp. A9 is in Cp. 
(10)  Tenth house is in Ge. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from Ge to Pi, 
we get a count of 10. Counting 10 signs from Pi, we  get Sg. However, this is 
in the 7 th  from the original sign (Ge). So we take the 10 th  therefrom (from Sg) 
and get Vi. A10 is in Vi. 
(11)  Eleventh house is in Cn. Lord is Moon and he is in Ge. Counting from Cn to 
Ge, we get a count of 12. Counting 12 signs from Ge, we get Ta. A11 is in Ta. 
(12)  Twelfth house is in Le. Lord is Sun and he is in Pi . Counting from Le to Pi, 
we get a count of 8. Counting 8 signs from Pi, we get Li. UL is in Li.

Exercise 12:  Find arudha padas of all the 12 houses in Chart 2. 
Hint : Mars is with 2 other planets and Ketu is with onl y one planet. So Mars is 
stronger than Ketu and works as the lord of Sc. Sat urn is alone and Rahu is with 
another planet. So Rahu is stronger and works as the lord of Aq.

9.3  Use of Arudha Lagna 
 
While lagna stands for true self, arudha lagna (AL)  stands for the maya associated 
with self. It shows the how the native is perceived  in the material world. It shows the 
status of the native. A timid and confused individu al may be perceived in the world 
as a strong leader. In that case, that is the maya associated with his personality and 
AL shows it. 
 
Because arudha lagna deals with maya, illusions, pe rceptions and impressions, it is 
very important in judging various materialistic thi ngs. For example, Parasara and 

--- Page 102 ---
  
 
 90 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Jaimini taught that the 11 th  and 12 th  houses from AL show financial gains and 
expenditures. Natural malefics in the 3 rd  and 6 th  houses from AL show someone who 
is perceived as a bold person who hits enemies hard . Since such impressions are 
usually formed about materially successful people, malefics in the 3 rd  and 6 th  from 
AL make one bold and materially successful. Natural  benefics in the 3 rd  and 6 th  
houses from AL make one very gentle and restrained in public behavior. Such a 
person does not fight with others boldly. This comb ination is usually found in the 
charts of saints and saintly and mild-natured people. 
 
The 10 
th  house from lagna in D-10 shows one’s true conduct in society. It shows the 
one’s career and the true nature of one’s karma (wo rk). The 10 th  house from AL in 
D-10 shows perceptions about one’s conduct in socie ty. It deals more with one’s 
status in career. 
 
9.4  Use of Bhava Arudhas 
 
Arudha padas show the maya (illusion) of material w orld. Arudha pada of n
th  house 
shows the maya associated with the matters signified by of nth  house. 
 
For example, 1 
st  house stands for self. While the first house from lagna stands for 
true self, its arudha pada (AL) stands for the maya  associated with self. It shows the 
how the native is perceived in the material world. It shows the status of the native. 
 
The 4 
th  house in D-16 shows happiness from vehicle. It sho ws true happiness from a 
vehicle. 
 
One may be very happy with a Bajaj Chetak (an inexp ensive two-wheel vehicle 
popular in India) or even a bicycle and one owning three Mercedes Benz cars may be 
unhappy with them and always dreaming of owning a b etter vehicle. One’s true 
happiness from vehicle has nothing to do with the t ype of vehicle owned. However, 
people perceive one with 3 Mercedes Benz cars as a happier person in the matter of 
vehicle, compared to a Chetak owner. This is the ma ya associated with “happiness 
from vehicle” in this material world. So this is shown by A4. 
 
Benefics influencing the 4 
th  house in D-16 show someone who is happy with his 
vehicle(s). Benefics influencing A4 in D-16 show so meone who is perceived to be 
happy with his vehicle(s). So planets influencing A 4 in D-16 shed light on the 

--- Page 103 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 91 
 
 
 
physical vehicle owned by a person. Someone with Ve nus in own sign in A4 and 
Saturn in 4 
th  (in D-16) may own luxurious vehicles ( i.e.  perceived to be happy with 
respect to vehicle) but not be happy. Someone with Saturn in A4 and Venus and 
Jupiter in 4 th  (in D-16) may own a small vehicle ( i.e.  perceived to be unhappy with 
respect to vehicles), but be happy with it. 
 
As shown above, 4 
th  house in D-16 deals with happiness from vehicles. In D-24, 4 th  
house deals with learning and education. A4 in D-24  deals with the maya (illusion) 
associated with learning. What is it? 
 
If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering instit ute of India), people may think that 
he is very knowledgable. If someone studied at an o bscure university, people may 
not get the same impression. But it is possible tha t people’s perceptions are wrong 
and the person who studied at IIT is less knowledgable. 
 
So A4 in D-24 shows the school or university and th e environment in which one’s 
learning takes place. Usually that decides what imp ression people form about one’s 
learning. 
 
Similarly, A10 in D-10 shows the maya associated wi th one’s karma (action – 
career). We form an impression about one’s career b ased on the place and 
environment where one’s work takes place. So A10 in  D-10 shows one’s workplace. 
One with Mars in A10 in D-10 may work at dynamic pl aces or engineering 
companies. One with Jupiter in A10 in D-10 may work  at a university or college or a 
court of law or a temple. 
 
One important arudha pada used in Jyotish is upapad a lagna (UL) – the arudha pada 
of the 12 
th  house. This shows one’s marriage and spouse. Plane ts in UL show the 
kind of marriage one has and the kind of spouse one  gets. For example, Mercury in 
UL can show intelligent (when good) or indecisive ( when bad) spouse. Ketu in UL 
can show spiritual (when good) or short-tempered (when bad) spouse. Sun in UL can 
show a charming spouse from a respectable family. I t can also show an authoritative 
spouse. Mars in UL may show a bold spouse (when goo d) and a quarrelsome spouse 
(when bad). 
 
The 8 
th  house from UL shows the longevity of marriage and the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses 
from UL show the end of marriage. Malefics like Mar s, Saturn and nodes in these 
houses from UL can result in troubles for the marriage and even a divorce. 

--- Page 104 ---
  
 
 92 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Nature of spouse and the length of the marriage are  two different issues. If Mars and 
Saturn are in UL and Jupiter is in the 8 
th  from UL, it may show a long marriage to an 
argumentative and mean spouse. If Jupiter is in UL and Mars and Saturn in the 8 th  
from it, one may have a noble spouse but the marital life will be very rough and there 
can even be a divorce. In such a case, propitiating  Saturn and Mars can help (for 
more, see the chapter on “Remedial Measures”).  
 
The 7 
th  house shows relations and A7 (darapada) shows the illusion associated with 
them, i.e.  the kind of people one usually interacts with. Bas ed on the kind of people 
one deals with, we perceive the nature of one’s rel ations. If one has a friend who is a 
prostitute, people may get a negative impression ab out one’s dealings. If one has a 
friend who is a famous film star, there is some gla mour associated with one’s 
relations. Thus darapada shows the kind of people o ne associates with and that plays 
an important role in forming people’s impressions a bout one’s relations. In D-10, 
darapada may show professional associates. In D-24,  it may show friends at college 
or colleagues in the pursuit of knowledge. In D-20, it may show colleagues or friends 
in religious activities. 
 
The 3 
rd  house shows one’s boldness. The 3 rd  house from lagna and the 3 rd  house from 
Mars show one’s true boldness and the 3 rd  house from AL shows how bold one is 
perceived. In addition, A3 shows the maya surroundi ng one’s boldness. It shows 
what drives the perceptions of people about one’s b oldness. The weapons one 
possesses may drive those perceptions and A3 may show one’s weapons. 
 
The 3 
rd  house also shows one’s communication skills. The 3 rd  house in D-24 (chart 
of learning and knowledge) and D-10 (achievements i n society) may show one’s 
writing skills. A3 shows the maya associated with one’s writing skills. One may have 
excellent writing skills, but not write any book. I n such a case, people may not really 
appreciate one’s writing skills. One may be an aver age writer, but end up writing 20 
books. In such a case, people may perceive him as a  great writer. Thus the exact 
books written by one decide the perceptions of the world about one’s writing skills. 
So A3 in D-24 and D-10 may show the books or articl es written by him. In this 
author’s D-10, for example, A3 is in Pisces. This c an mean that he will be known for 
some books on saattwik and traditional subjects and astrology certainly fits the bill. 
 
Let us take the 5 
th  house as another example. It shows intelligence, f ollowing, 
devotion etc . The 5 th  house in D-20, the chart of religious activities, shows one’s 

--- Page 105 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 93 
 
 
 
devotion ( bhakti ) in religious activities. A5 in D-20 shows the thi ngs based on which 
the world forms an impression about one’s devotion.  The mantras one recites, the 
poojas and the religious rituals one performs control the impression of the world 
about one’s devotion in religious matters. So A5 shows them. 
 
The 5 
th  house in D-10, the chart of career, shows the foll owing one has. The world 
forms an impression about one’s following based on the power wielded by one. A 
political leader in a position of power is assumed to have a lot of following. So A5 
can show the trappings of power enjoyed by one. It can also show awards. 
 
In D-24, the chart of learning, the 5 
th  house may show intelligence. A5 in D-24 
shows the things based on which the world forms an impression about one’s 
intelligence in learning. These impressions are usu ally formed based on one’s 
performances in examinations, one’s scores in tests  and one’s academic distinctions. 
So that is what A5 in D-24 shows. 
 
Similarly, the 9 
th  house shows one’s fortune. In D-24, it may show fo rtune related to 
learning. It can show the guidance received by one (i.e.  guru – teacher). But the 
world forms an impression about one’s fortune in le arning, based on the degrees 
received by one. One with an advanced degree is ass umed to be more fortunate with 
respect to learning than one with a simple degree. So A9 can show one’s higher 
degrees. 
 
In this manner, intelligent and blessed students ca n clearly understand the meanings 
of various arudha padas in various divisional chart s. One cannot become a good 
Vedic astrologer by memorizing a lot of tables. One  needs to understand the basics 
clearly and apply them intelligently. 
 
All the principles of Vedic astrology should be und erstood and applied in the context 
of “desa” (country – place), “kaala” (time – age) a nd “paatra” (nature and class of 
the persons involved). When we interpret arudha pad as, we are talking about the 
things based on which the world forms an impression  about an aspect of the native. 
The things that drive the world’s perceptions can b e different based on which world 
we are living in. They vary significantly from one place to another, from one age to 
another and from one class to another. Intelligent use of arudhas requires an 
astrologer to understand the world that the native lives in.

9.5  Computation of Graha Arudhas 
 
Just as arudha padas of all houses (bhavas) are def ined, arudha padas of all the nine 
planets (grahas) are also defined and they are call ed graha arudhas. They are 
computed as follows: 
 
(1)  Take the sign containing the planet of interest in the divisional chart of interest. 
(2)  Find the sign owned by that planet. 
N
OTE : Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn own 2 si gns each. In 
their case, take the stronger sign owned by the pla net. The chapter on 
“Strength of Planets and Rasis” will explain the rules used in comparing 
the strengths of signs. Take the two signs, apply t hose rules and find the 
stronger sign. 
(3)  Count signs from the sign containing the planet of interest to the stronger sign 
owned by it. Counting is in the zodiacal direction always. For example, if the 
planet we are interested in is Sun and he is Gemini , we count signs from Gemini 
to Leo and get 3. 
(4)  Count the same number of signs from the stronger si gn owned and find the 
ending sign. In the above example, we count 3 signs  from Leo and we end up in 
Libra. 
(5)  Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1 st  or 7 th  from the original 
sign containing the planet, then we take the 10 th  sign from the sign found in step 
(4). Otherwise we don’t make any change. 
(6)  The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the planet of interest. 
 
Example 30: Find the arudha padas of all the planets in Chart 1. 
 
(1)  Sun is in Pi. From Pi, Sun’s own sign Le is the 6 
th  sign. Counting 6 signs from 
Le, we get Cp. So Cp contains Sun’s arudha pada. 
(2)  Moon is in Ge. From Ge, Moon’s own sign Cn is the 2 nd  sign. Counting 2 signs 
from Cn, we get Le. So Le contains Moon’s arudha pada. 
(3)  Mars is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Ar and Sc. Ar is s tronger as it contains more 
planets. From Ar, Ar is the 1 st  sign. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we get Ar. Because 

--- Page 107 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 95 
 
 
 
this is the 1 
st  house from the sign containing Mars, we take the 10 th  therefrom and 
get Cp. So Cp contains the arudha pada of Mars. 
(4)  Mercury is in Pi. He owns 2 signs – Ge and Vi. Ge is stronger as it has Moon and 
Vi is empty. From Pi, Ge is the 4 th  sign. Counting 4 signs from Ge, we get Vi. 
Since Vi is the 7 th  from Pi, we take the 10 th  from Vi and get Ge. So Ge contains 
Mercury’s arudha pada. 
(5)  Jupiter is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Sg and Pi. Pi is stronger as it has 3 planets and 
Sg is empty. From Ar, Pi is the 12 th  sign. Counting 12 signs from Pi, we get Aq. 
So Aq contains Jupiter’s arudha pada. 
(6)  Venus is in Pi. He owns 2 signs – Ta and Li. Li is stronger (it will become clear 
after reading the chapter on “Strength of Planets a nd Rasis”.). From Pi, Li is the 
8th  sign. Counting 8 signs from Li, we get Ta. So Ta c ontains the arudha pada of 
Venus. 
(7)  Saturn is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Aq and Cp. Cp is  stronger as it has Ketu and 
Aq is empty. From Ar, Cp is the 10 th  sign. Counting 10 signs from Cp, we get Li. 
Since Li is the 7 th  from Ar, we take the 10 th  from Li and get Cn. So Cn contains 
Saturn’s arudha pada. 
(8)  Rahu is in Cn. From Cn, Rahu’s own sign Aq is the 8 th  sign. Counting 8 signs 
from Aq, we get Vi. So Vi contains Rahu’s arudha pada. 
(9)  Ketu is in Cp. From Cp, Ketu’s own sign Sc is the 1 1 th  sign. Counting 11 signs 
from Sc, we get Vi. So Vi contains Ketu’s arudha pada. 
 
Exercise 13: Find arudha padas of all the nine planets in Chart 2. 
Hint : Out of the 2 signs owned by Mars, Mercury, Jupite r, Venus and Saturn, Ar, Ta, 
Vi, Sg and Aq are stronger (respectively). 
 
N
OTE : In divisional charts in which Ketu is in the 7 th  from Rahu, his maya (arudha 
pada) is with Rahu’s maya. In divisional charts in which Rahu and Ketu are together, 
their mayas are in opposite rasis. The readers may ponder over the philosophical 
significance of this. 
 
9.6  Use of Graha Arudhas 
 
Just as arudha padas of various houses show the ill usions of the world related to the 
matters signified by various houses, arudha padas o f various planets show the 

--- Page 108 ---
  
 
 96 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
illusions of the native  related to the matters signified by various planet s. Houses 
show various aspects of the person’s life and their  arudhas show how they are 
perceived in the world. Planets show various person s, forces and situations that 
impact various aspects of a person’s life and their  arudhas show the related 
perceptions by the person. 
 
Just as the perceptions of the world about a native  can be totally different from the 
reality, perceptions of a native about himself, abo ut the world and about the 
situations that (s)he goes through can be totally d ifferent from the reality. Graha 
arudhas throw light on these perceptions. 
 
Example 31: 
Let us consider Moon’s periods for the native in Chart 1. Because Moon is in the 10 
th  
house, his periods will give important developments related to career. Because Moon 
owns the 2 nd  from AL and occupies AL, status of the native in the eyes of people will 
increase in Moon’s periods. However, Moon’s arudha pada is in the 12 th  from lagna. 
This will make the native feel frustrated. The nati ve will be unhappy and under the 
illusion that things are going bad for him. But peo ple will think that his status is 
increasing and there will be some good developments in career in reality. 
 
Example 32: 
Let us consider India’s Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vaj payee’s rasi chart given in Chart 
3. Jupiter’s period ran in 1980’s and 1990’s. With Jupiter in the 2 
nd  house from AL, 
his dasa can give a rise in material fortune. With Jupiter being a functional benefic 
for Scorpio lagna and occupying a quadrant, Jupiter  dasa should give comforts in 
reality. However, Jupiter’s arudha pada is in Libra , the 12 th  house from lagna. This 
can make the native feel unhappy, uncomfortable and  alienated. Graha arudhas show 
how the native feels. 
 
In Rahu’s sub-period in Jupiter’s period, the nativ e became India’s Prime Minister. 
Rahu is in the 8 
th  house from lagna and his periods should cause disc omfort, 
frustration and health troubles in reality. However , being a natural malefic in the 6 th  
house from AL, Rahu can give material success and v ictory over enemies and rivals.  
That is how the world perceives him. Rahu’s arudha pada is in Libra, i.e.  the 12 th  
house from lagna. This can again make the native fr ustrated and unhappy. However, 
if we are interested in the native’s material success, Rahu’s 6 th  house placement from 
AL is the most important factor and success is ensured.

Chart 3 
 
 
Example 33: 
Consider the native of Chart 4. Let us see what res ults Ketu’s period can give him. 
Ketu is in lagna. Ketu in lagna can make one spirit ual. In Ketu dasa, this native 
joined a spiritual movement and started meditating regularly. 
 
From AL, Ketu is in 3 
rd . As a natural malefic in the 3 rd  from AL, Ketu can give 
boldness and material success. He was indeed materially successful. 
 
How did the native feel in this dasa? Look at Ketu’ s arudha pada. It is in Capricorn, 
the 5 
th  house from lagna. Ketu in 5 th  gives proficiency in mathematics and abstract 
analysis and makes one do intelligent work. This ma y be how the native felt about 
his activities in that period. 
 
In this manner, we can use graha arudha to understa nd the illusions the native is 
under. Illusion should not be looked at as a bad wo rd here. We are all constantly 

--- Page 110 ---
  
 
 98 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
under illusion. Basically graha arudhas show the pe rceptions of the native. They 
show how the native feels. 
 
Judging the positions of planets with respect to la gna, we can understand the real 
situation. Judging the positions of planets with re spect to AL, we can understand the 
perceptions of people and the situation at a materi alistic level. Judging the positions 
of the arudha padas of planets with respect to lagn a, we can understand how the 
native perceives the situation and how the native f eels. Unless we understand this 
aspect correctly, we cannot offer good astrological  counselling. When we counsel a 
person, we must understand how the person feels and  what drives those feelings. So, 
each of these 3 aspects of chart analysis is import ant in its own right. A good student 
of Vedic astrology will master all the 3 aspects.

Arudha pada of a house shows the maya surrounding t he matters signified by that 
house. It shows the factors based on which the impr essions of people are formed.

Arudha lagna or AL shows people’s impressions about a native. It shows one’s status 
in the material world. Darapada or A7 shows one’s r elationships. Upapada (UL) 
shows one’s marriage and spouse. A4 in D-16 shows o ne’s vehicle. A4 in D-24 
shows one’s school or college or university (place of education). A10 in D-10 shows 
one’s workplace. 
 
Arudha padas of planets show the perceptions of the  native about the world, about 
himself or herself and about the situations developing in his or her life. 
 
Analysis of the positions of planets with respect t o lagna shows reality. Analysis of 
the positions of planets with respect to AL shows p erceptions of the world and 
material situation. Analysis of individual bhava ar udhas throws light on various 
things based on which world forms impressions about  a native. Analysis of the 
positions of the arudha padas of planets with respe ct to lagna shows the perceptions 
of the native.

10.  Aspects and Argalas 
 
10.1  Introduction 
 
Planets aspect other planets, rasis and houses in a strology. A planet aspecting a 
house or a planet has some influence on the matters  signified by that house or planet. 
The nature of the influence exerted and the degree to which that influence succeeds 
depends on the individual situation. 
 
There are 2 kinds of aspects: (1) graha drishti and  (2) rasi drishti. Drishti means 
aspect. Each planet aspects certain houses from it with graha drishti (planetary 
aspect). The houses aspected are fixed based on the  planet. In addition, rasis aspect 
each other and a planet aspects the rasis aspected by the rasi occupied by it. This is 
called rasi drishti (sign aspect). 
 
10.2  Graha Drishri 
 
All planets aspect the 7 
th  house from them. For example, Sun in Ta aspects Sc . Mars 
in Ge aspects Sg. Moon in Le aspects Aq. Jupiter in  Pi aspects Vi. Saturn in Cp 
aspects Cn. Find the 7 th  house from the planet and the planet aspects that house. 
 
In addition, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have special aspects: 
 
• Jupiter aspects the 5 
th  and 9 th  houses from him, in addition to the 7 th  house. 
• Mars aspects the 4 th  and 8 th  houses from him, in addition to the 7 th  house. 
• Saturn aspects the 3 rd  and 10 th  houses from him, in addition to the 7 th  house. 
 
We can decide the signs and houses aspected by a pl anet as above. If any planet 
occupies the aspected houses, then the planet is al so aspected. For example, Jupiter 
in Ta will aspect Saturn in Cp, because Cp is the 9
th  house from Ta and Jupiter 
aspects the 9 th  from him. 
 

--- Page 113 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 101 
 
 
 
Example 34: 
Let us say Jupiter is in Ge, Mars in Le and Saturn in Sg. Jupiter in Ge will aspect the 
5
th , 7 th  and 9 th  from Ge. So Jupiter in Ge will aspect Li, Sg and A q. Mars in Le will 
aspect the 4 th , 7 th  and 8 th  from Le. So Mars in Le will aspect Sc, Aq and Pi. Saturn in 
Sg will aspect the 3 rd , 7 th  and 10 th  from Sg. So Saturn in Sg will aspect Aq, Ge and 
Vi. 
 
Look at a few charts and figure out which planets a re aspecting which houses and 
which planets are aspecting which planets. With experience, you can become good at 
it and this is an important skill required in interpreting charts.

--- Page 114 ---
  
 
 102 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Rasis aspect other rasis based on the following rules: 
 
• A movable rasi aspects all fixed rasis except the one adjacent to it. 
• A fixed rasi aspects all movable rasis except the one adjacent to it. 
• A dual rasi aspects all other dual rasis. 
 
For example, Ar is a movable sign. It aspects all t he fixed signs except the one 
adjacent to it, i.e.  Ta. So Ar aspects Le, Sc and Aq. 
 
Ta is a fixed sign. It aspects all the movable sign s except the one adjacent to it, i.e.  
Ar. So Ta aspects Cn, Li and Cp. 
 
Ge is a dual sign. It aspects all other dual signs. So Ge aspects Vi, Sg and Pi.

It may be noted that sign Y will aspect sign X if s ign X aspects sign Y. A visual 
representation of rasi aspects is given in Figure 2. A line is drawn between every pair 
of signs that aspect each other. A planet aspects t he signs aspected by the sign it 
occupies. It also aspects the houses and planets in  those signs. This aspect is called 

--- Page 115 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 103 
 
 
 
rasi drishti (sign aspect). For example, a planet i n Libra will aspect the houses and 
planets in Aq, Ta and Le. 
 
Exercise 15: Find the rasis, houses and planets aspected with rasi drishti by Sun, 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in Chart 5. 
 
10.4  Graha Drishti vs Rasi Drishti 
 
A simple analogy will make things clearer. Look at planets as people. Let us take a 
priest as an example. Will he have some influence o n his neighbors? Probably. 
Because he lives there, gets up early in the mornin g and recites mantras, it may 
influence his neighbors also. Because of the houses  they live in, his neighbors come 
under his influence. How pious and god-fearing his influence makes his neighbors 
depends on other factors. If one of the neighbors i s a dreaded criminal, he is not 
going to be influenced. 
 
Let us take a dreaded criminal as another example. He may also have an influence on 
his neighbors. Youngsters living in the neighboring  houses may enter the criminal 
world because of him. Ladies in the neighboring hou ses may stay inside their houses 
at night and not come out after certain time. 
 
Thus we are influenced by people in neighboring hou ses. Influence exerted by 
planets by rasi drishti is similar to this influence. 
 
Compared to this limited influence on the neighbors , a priest may have greater 
influence in the matters of the nearby temple where  he works. He may have a lot of 
influence on devotees who come to visit the temple and who approach him for 
performing poojas, homas etc . Influence exerted with graha drishti is similar t o this 
influence. 
 
Influence exerted by rasi drishti is due to the sig n a planet is in. This is analogous to 
the influence people exert on their neighbors. All planets in a sign will have rasi 
drishti on the same signs, just as people living in  the same house see the same 
neighbors everyday and exert some influence over th e same neighbors. But the 
influence they exert may differ. A priest may tell his neighbors to pray to God. His 
movie-loving brother living in the same house may t alk the same neighbors into 

--- Page 116 ---
  
 
 104 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
watching all the movies of a particular actress. Th us, planets in the same sign exert 
influence on the same houses and planets through ra si drishti, but the nature of the 
influence varies from planet to planet. 
 
Influence exerted by graha drishti is due to the in herent nature of a planet. Different 
planets in the same sign may aspect different house s and planets with graha drishti. 
A priest may have great influence over the devotees at the temple he works at and his 
movie-loving brother living in the same house may h ave great influence over his 
movie-loving classmates and co-members of the fan c lub of an actress, of which he 
is president. Similarly, planets in the same sign m ay influence planets in different 
houses. However, everyone in a house may have a str ong influence over friends of 
the family who visit the house frequently. Similarl y, all planets aspect the 7 
th  house 
from them and have an influence over it. 
 
10.5  Argala (Intervention) 
 
In addition to the influence caused by planets with graha drishti and rasi drishti, there 
is another influence called “argala”. 
 
Argala is a very important concept in Vedic astrolo gy. Literally speaking, argala 
means “a bolt”. Argala on a house shows the influen ces that intervene in its affairs, 
decide some parts of it and close the bolt on it, s o to speak. Planet having rasi drishti 
have a small influence. Planets having graha drisht i have a more concrete influence. 
Planets with argala simply decide some parts of the  matter signified by the house. 
The influence caused by argala is decisive. 
 
A planet or house in the 2 
nd , 4 th  and 11 th  houses from a planet or house causes 
primary argala on the latter.  Argala by a benefic planet is called a “subhaargal a” 
(benefic intervention) and argala by a malefic plan et is called a “paapaargala” 
(malefic intervention). This simple concept can be better appreciated if some 
examples are given.  
 
The 4 
th  house stands for education. The 2 nd , 4 th  and 11 th  from the 4 th  house are 5 th , 7 th  
and 2 nd  houses respectively. One’s intelligence (5 th ), interaction with others (7 th ) and 
and overall character and samskara  (2 nd ) make or break one education. If Jupiter is in 
5th  house, he will give intelligence and his subhargal a (benefic intervention) on 4 th  
will help one’s education. If Rahu is in 5 th  house, his papargala (malefic 

--- Page 117 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 105 
 
 
 
intervention) on 4 
th  will cause obstacles in one’s education by way of poor 
intelligence. Similarly, benefics and malefics in t he houses causing argala cause 
good and bad intervention. Basically, the point is that intelligence, interaction and 
samskara are the things that decide one’s education. They have a decisive role. 
 
Let us take another example. Short journeys are see n from the 3 
rd  house. What are 
the things necessary for a journey? One needs a veh icle (4 th ). One may need 
someone to serve one by driving the vehicle. Servan ts are seen from 6 th . So, no 
wonder the 4 th  and 6 th  houses cause argala on the 3 rd  house, being the 2 nd  and 4 th  
from it respectively! If one has papargala on 3 rd  from 4 th , it may show trouble to the 
journey because of the vehicle. If one has papargal a on 3 rd  from 6 th , it may show 
trouble to the journey because of the driver. 
 
Let us take another example. Domestic harmony, comf ort, well-being and happiness 
are seen from the 4 
th  house. What are the things that can make or break domestic 
harmony? Of course, wife, children and other family  members! Each of them can 
intervene in one’s domestic harmony. No wonder the 5 th , 7 th  and 2 nd  houses have an 
argala on the 4 th  house (being the 2 nd , 4 th  and 11 th  respectively from the 4 th  house)! If 
a malefic in 5 th  has papargala on 4 th , it may show domestic clashes and lack of sukha 
(comfort/happiness) on account of a child. If a ben efic in 7 th  has subhargala on on 
4th , it may show domestic happiness due to a caring partner. 
 
Apart from the 2 
nd , 4 th  and 11th  houses from a house, the 5 th  house from a house has a 
secondary  argala on it. In the case of learning, argala of 8 th  house on 4 th  (8 th  is the 5 th  
from 4 th ) shows the influence of hard work in learning. Hard work is another decider. 
In the case of journey, argala of 7 th  house on 3 rd  house (7 th  is the 5 th  from 3 rd ) shows 
the influence of partners in a journey. 
 
10.6  Virodhargala (Obstruction) 
 
Virodhargala shows the obstruction of argala. Plane ts and houses in the 12 
th , 10 th , 3 rd  
and 9 th  houses from a house or planet cause virodhargala and obstruct the argala on it 
from the 2 nd , 4 th , 11 th  and 5 th  houses from it ( respectively ). For example, let us say 
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are in Ge, Pi, Ar and Vi respectively. Saturn is in 
the 4 th  from Mercury and Ge and he causes argala on them. With Saturn being a 
malefic, this is a paapaargala (malefic interventio n). But Jupiter is in the 10 th  from 
Mercury and Ge. So he obstructs Saturn’s argala and  averts the troubles. Venus is in 

--- Page 118 ---
  
 
 106 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
the 11 th  from Mercury and Ge and so he causes argala on the m. With Venus being a 
benefic, it is a subhaargala (benefic intervention) . If Le (3 rd  from Ge) is empty, this 
argala is unobstructed. 
 
N
OTE : If a sign contains Ketu, argalas and virodhargala s on it are counted anti-
zodiacally. For example, let us say Ketu is in Vi. Then Le, Ge, Sc and Ta are the 2 nd , 
4th , 11 th  and 5 th  from Vi (counted anti-zodiacally) and planets in t hose signs cause 
argala on Vi and on the planets in Vi. Virodhargala is also counted similarly. 
 
Exercise 16: Find the planets causing argalas and virodhargalas  on all the 12 houses 
in Chart 5. 
 
There is a special principle regarding the 3 
rd  house obstruction. If there are several 
malefics in the 3 rd  house from a house or a planet, they cause argala instead of 
virodhargala on that house or planet. 
 
10.7  Use of Argala 
 
Depending on the matter of interest, take the relev ant house or the relevant karaka. 
Find argalas and virodhargalas on it. If there are both, see if more planets cause 
argala or virodhargala. If they are caused by the s ame number of planets, compare 
the strengths and decide whether argala dominates o r virodhargala. Based on the 
signs, houses and planets involved, guess the meaning of the argala or virodhargala. 
 
Argala from the 2 
nd  house shows the basic ingredient for the sustenanc e of a matter. 
For example, the 2 nd  house shows food and it is a basic ingredient for the sustenance 
of self (1 st ). The 5 th  house shows intelligence and it is a basic ingredi ent for the 
sustenance of learning (4 th ). 
 
Argala from the 4 
th  house shows the basic factor that drives the mood,  state and 
progress of a matter. For example, the 4 th  house shows comfort and it drives the 
mood and state of self (1 st ). The 7 th  house shows interaction and that drives one’s 
learning (4 th ). 
 

--- Page 119 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 107 
 
 
 
Argala from the 11 
th  house shows the catalyst that can result in gains for a matter. 
For example, the 2 nd  house shows character, grooming and samskara and it is a 
catalyst in the process of learning (4 th ). 
 
Secondary argala from the 5 
th  house shows the additional contributing factors. F or 
example, the 5 th  house shows emotional situation and that contribut es to the state of 
self (1 st ). The 8 th  house shows hard work and that contributes to one’s learning (4 th ). 
 
Using the above guidelines, we can understand the m eaning of argalas on houses and 
karakas. 
 
Chart 6 
 
Example 35:  Consider India’s former Prime Minister Sri P.V. Na rasimha Rao’s 
chart shown in Chart 6. Let us find the planets hav ing a decisive influence on his 
livelihood and karma (action) in society. 
 
Saturn is the significator of livelihood and karma.  Argalas on him denote decisive 
influences on livelihood and karma. Mercury, Mars a nd Sun have an argala on 

--- Page 120 ---
  
 
 108 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Saturn, as they are in the 11 th  from him. Mercury’s influence indicates writing an d 
scholarliness. Sun and Mars suggest politics.  
 
Chart 7 
 
Example 36:  Consider the chart shown in Chart 7. It belongs to  well-known 
Hollywood actor and former US President Ronald Reag an. Let us find the planets 
having a decisive influence on his livelihood and k arma. The only planet with an 
argala on Saturn is Venus in the 11 th  from Saturn. Thus he was an actor, entertainer 
and a showman. In Example 35, Sun has an argala on Saturn and politics was the 
native’s livelihood. In this chart, on the other ha nd, Sun has no argala and the native 
entered politics late. His political power is indic ated by Sun’s unobstructed argala on 
GL. 
 
Exercise 17: Try to guess the nature of livelihood and karma (action) of the native in 
Chart 8. Don’t look at the answer until you think a lot. 
Hint : Being in own house, Venus dominates over Jupiter and Mercury. Being the 
most advanced planet, Mercury is also strong. Mars dominates over Sun and Ketu, 
being in own house and being more advanced than Ketu – the other owner of Sc.

Exercise 17: 
Saturn is the significator of livelihood and karma.  He shows what kind of activity a 
native engages in. Being in a watery sign, he shows  something flexible and fluid. By 
studying the argalas on him, we can see the decisiv e influences on the nature of his 
karma. 
 
Venus is in the 4 
th  from Saturn. His argala on Saturn shows creative a nd aesthetic 
work ( e.g.  actor, poet etc). Though Venus is in own sign, Mer cury is more advanced 
and Mercury also has influence over Saturn through his argala. Mercury and Venus 
together show intelligent and logical work of an ae sthetic nature. Being the 4 th  house 
argala, this influence is the basic driving factor of the native’s karma. 
 
Mars is very strong in the 5 
th  house from Saturn and he also has a secondary arga la. 
Martian influence gives discipline, systematicity a nd enterprise. He can denote some 
design work. Mars engineers things. 
 
Rahu is in the 11 
th  from Saturn and he has a malefic argala on Saturn.  Rahu stands 
for pathbreaking innovation and also shady elements  of society. His 11 th  house 
argala can denote gains in his livelihood with those factors working as catalysts. 
 
The final answer : The native was a very famous and successful fashi on designer. He 
had mafia connections. He was finally shot dead.

11.  Yogas 
 
11.1  Introduction 
 
We have seen in previous chapters the use of divisi onal charts, houses, karakas, 
arudha padas, aspects and argalas. Using all these tools, we can interpret charts and 
draw various conclusions about a native’s fortune. 
 
In addition to these general guidelines, there are several specific combinations that 
give specific results. These are very important and  called “Yogas”. Readers are 
advised to refer to classics such as “Brihat Parasa ra Hora Sastram” and acquaint 
themselves with as many yogas as possible. Dr. B.V.  Raman’s “Three Hundred 
Important Combinations” is an excellent compendium on yogas. 
 
Some software programs list the yogas present in a chart. However, they are 
sometimes erroneous and one should be familiar with  important yogas and be able to 
judge yogas by oneself, without relying on software . Many yogas are applicable in 
divisional charts. When we use yogas in divisional charts, we should interpret the 
results ascribed to a yoga based on the matters signified by the divisional chart. 
 
A few key yogas will be listed in this chapter, but  the reader is urged to do more 
reading. In this book, yogas are divided into the following classes for convenience: 
 
• Ravi Yogas (solar combinations) 
• Chandra Yogas (lunar combinations) 
• Mahaapurusha Yogas (combinations producing 5 kinds of great men) 
• Naabhasa Yogas (classified celestial combinations) 
• Other Popular Yogas 
• Raaja Yogas (combinations giving power) 
• Raaja Sambandha Yogas (combinations for association with kings) 
• Dhana Yogas (combinations giving wealth) 
• Daridra Yogas (combinations giving poverty)

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 113 
 
 
 
11.2  Ravi Yogas 
 
Ravi yogas are the solar combinations. There are several yogas based on Sun. 
 
Because Mercury and Venus are with Sun or a sign aw ay from him most of the time, 
the following yogas are very common in rasi chart. However, they are less common 
in divisional charts. One can apply these yogas in D-9 and D-10 in particular. 
 
11.2.1  Vesi Yoga 
 
Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 2 
nd  house from Sun, then this 
yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Gemini a nd Jupiter and Mercury are in 
Cancer, then this yoga is present. 
 
Results: One born with this yoga has a balanced outlook. He is truthful, tall and 
sluggish. He is happy and comfortable even with little wealth. 
 
11.2.2  Vosi Yoga 
 
Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 12 
th  house from Sun, then this 
yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Aries an d Jupiter and Venus are in Pisces, 
then this yoga is present. 
 
Results: One born with this yoga is skillful, charitable, famous, learned and strong. 
 
11.2.3  Ubhayachara Yoga 
 
Definition: If there are planets other than Moon in the 2 
nd  and  12 th  houses from Sun, 
then this yoga is present. For example, if Sun is i n Cancer, Mars is in Leo and Venus 
is in Gemini, then this yoga is present. 
 
Results: One born with this yoga has all comforts. He is a king or an equal. 
 
11.2.4  Budha-Aaditya Yoga (Nipuna Yoga) 
 

--- Page 126 ---
  
 
 114 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Definition: Budha means Mercury, Aaditya means Sun and yoga mea ns 
togetherness. If Sun and Mercury are together (in one sign), this yoga is present. 
 
Results: One born with this yoga is intelligent and skillful  in all works. He is well-
known, respected and happy. Nipuna means an expert. 
 
Note: If Mercury is too close to Sun, he is combust ( asta or astangata ). Yogas 
formed by combust planets lose some of their power to do good. This yoga is the

11.3  Chandra Yogas 
 
Chandra yogas are the lunar combinations. There are several yogas based on Moon. 
 
General Guidelines: 
 
(1)  If Moon is in a quadrant from Sun, then one may pos sess little wealth, 
intelligence and skills. If Moon is in a panapara f rom Sun, then one may possess 
average wealth, intelligence and skills. If Moon is in an apoklima from Sun, then 
one may possess a lot of wealth, intelligence and skills. 
 
(2)  If Moon is in own navamsa or that of an adhimitra ( good friend), that is good. In 
such a situation, aspect of Jupiter on Moon beings wealth and comforts in the 
case of daytime birth (respectively). The same result is given by Venusian aspect 
on Moon in the case of night birth. On the other ha nd, Jupiter’s aspect on Moon 
in a night birth and Venusian aspect on Moon in a d aytime birth are detrimental 
to one’s wealth and comforts. 
 
(3)  If all the natural benefics occupy upachayas (3 
rd , 6 th , 10 th  and 11 th ) from Moon, 
one has great wealth. If two benefics occupy upacha yas from Moon, the native 
has medium wealth. If only one benefic occupies an upachaya from Moon, the 
native has little wealth.

Matsya Yoga: If (1) benefics are in lagna and 9

Khadga Yoga: If (1) the 2 
nd  lord is in the 9 th  house, (2) the 9 th  lord is in the 2 nd  
house, and, (3) lagna lord is in a quadrant or a tr ine, then this yoga is present. One 
born with this yoga is skillful, wealthy, learned, happy, fortunate, intelligent, grateful 
and mighty. Khadga means a sword. 
 
Kusuma Yoga: If (1) lagna is in a fixed sign, (2) Venus is in a quadrant, (3) Moon is 
in a trine with a benefic, and, (4) Saturn is in the 10 
th  house, then this yoga is present. 
One born with this yoga becomes a king or an equal.  He is charitable. He is endowed 
with pleasures and happiness. He is a leader of his  community. He has character and 
scholarship. Kusuma means a flower. 
 
Kalaanidhi Yoga: If (1) Jupiter is in the 2 
nd  house or the 5 th  house and (2) he is 
conjoined or aspected by Mercury and Venus, then th is yoga is present. One born 
with this yoga is endowed with character, happiness , good health, wealth and 
learning. He is respected by kings. Kalaanidhi means a treasure of arts and skills. 
 
Kalpadruma Yoga: Consider (1) lagna lord, (2) his dispositor, (3) th e latter’s 
dispositor in rasi and (4) in navamsa. If all the f our planets are all in quadrants, trines 
or exaltation signs, then this yoga is present. An example will make this clearer. 
 
One born with this yoga becomes a king. He likes wa rs 
34 . He is very prosperous, 
principled, strong and kind. Kalpadruma is a celestial tree of the heaven. This yoga is 
also known as Paarijaata yoga. Paarijaata is a cele stial flower. Some authors have 
simplified this yoga and wrote that one of the last  two planets mentioned can bring 
the yoga if in a quadrant or a trine or exaltation sign. Taking all the four planets 
make this a less common yoga, which it ought to be. Let us follow Parasara. 
 
As an example, let us look at the rasi and navamsa charts of Chatrapati Shivaji, a 
great king of India (see Chart 9). Lagna lord is Su n. He is in Aq and his dispositor is 
Saturn (lord of Aq). Saturn is in Li and his dispos itor is Venus. We also need 
Saturn’s dispositor in navamsa. In navamsa, Saturn is in Aq and his dispositor is 
Saturn himself. 
  
                                                
 
34  This is not meant negatively. War and curbing bad elements are a king’s duty. The results of this 
yoga include the words “principled” and “kind”. So the expression “likes wars” (yuddhapriyah) 
should be taken in a positive sense. Shivaji’s example may explain it further.

Thus we get the four planets as — Sun, Saturn, Venu s and Saturn. Sun is in a 
quadrant. Saturn is exalted. Venus is in a trine. T hus Shivaji had Kalpadruma yoga. 
In navamsa also, Sun is exalted, Saturn is in moola trikona and Venus is in a lagna.

This makes the yoga even more powerful. He was inde ed a prosperous, principled, 
strong and kind king ever ready to take on powerful  enemies. Even as he was 
fighting mighty Muslim emperors, he was open-minded  and treated all his people 
equally. He respected every woman as a mother. He s tood for every good thing that

in particular.

th  and 8 th  houses from lagna are occupied by benefics

nd , 12 th  and 8 th  houses counted from the 2 nd  lord,

food and money and it is a trine from karma sthana – the 10 th  house. It stands for 
sustenance and its lord represents Hari – Sustainer of Hindu Trinity – in a chart. 
 
Hara Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4th, 9 
th  and 8 th  houses counted from the 7 th  lord, 
then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, learned and blessed with 
wealth and children. Hara is a name of Lord Shiva. The 7 th  house rules death and 
Shiva is represented by its lord. This is why the 7 th  house shows genitalia and Shiva 
is worshipped in the form of a Linga – Phallus – in Hindu temples. 
 
Brahma Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4 
th , 10 th  and 11 th  houses counted from lagna 
lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this  yoga is happy, learned and blessed

and the Creator is represented in a chart by lagna lord. 
 
N
OTE : (1) Some authors combine Hari yoga, Hara yoga and  Brahma yoga and call it 
“Hari Hara Brahma yoga”. Also, these three yogas ar e known as Trimurthi Yogas. 
Brahma is the Creator; Hari is the Sustainer; and, Shiva is the Destroyer. They form 
the Trinity of Gods (Trimurthis).

11.7  Raaja Yogas  
 
Raaja means a king. Raaja yogas are the combination s that give power and 
prosperity to a native. They make one the best in something. 
 
11.7.1  Basics 
 
Basic Raaja Yoga: In any chart, Lord Vishnu sits in the quadrants and  Goddess 
Lakshmi sits in the trines. If the lord of a quadra nt is associated with the lord of a 

--- Page 146 ---
  
 
 134 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
trine, that association brings the combined blessin gs of Lakshmi and Vishnu. This is 
called a Raaja Yoga. The native is powerful and prosperous. 
 
What do we mean by “association” here? There are 3 important associations: 
 
(1)  The two planets are conjoined, 
(2)  The two planets aspect each other with graha drishti, or, 
(3)  The two planets have a parivartana (exchange). For example, if the 4 
th  lord is in 
the 5 th  house and the 5 th  lord is in the 4 th  house, then we say that there is a 
parivartana between the 4 th  and 5 th  lords. This is an association. 
 
If the lord of a quadrant and the lord of a trine h ave one of the three kinds of 
associations mentioned above, it forms a Raaja Yoga . Lagna can be taken as a 
quadrant or a trine here. It is both. 
 
Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga: This is a special case of the above yoga. If the lo rds 
of dharma sthana (9 
th ) and karma sthana (10 th ) form a raja yoga, it is known by this 
special name. The 9 th  house is the most important trine and the 10 th  house is the most 
important quadrant. Raja yoga involving the lords o f these two houses is excellent. 
One born with this yoga is sincere, devoted and righteous. He is fortunate and. 
 
Vipareeta Raaja Yoga: The 6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  houses are known as trik sthanas or 
dusthanas (bad houses). If their lords occupies dus thanas or conjoin dusthanas, it 
results in this yoga. One having this yoga experien ces tremedous success, typically 
after an initial struggle. Vipareeta means extreme. 
 
Because dusthanas show the obstacles one faces in l ife, situation of dusthana lords in 
dusthanas shows that obstacles will run into obstac les themselves. One experiences 
tremendous success in the face of obstacles. 
 
In the ideal case, the lords of the 6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  houses will all be together in one of 
the three houses (or the 3 rd  house or the 11 th  house), with no other planets conjoining 
them. But the results of this yoga may be experienc ed with just one or two dusthana 
lords occupying a dusthana. 
 
11.7.2  Magnitude of a Raaja Yoga 
 

--- Page 147 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 135 
 
 
 
We find the conjunction of the lords of a quadrant and a trine in many charts. The 
magnitude to which this raaja yoga fructifies depen ds on the strength of the two 
planets. The key factors that come into play are: 
 
(1)  The two planets should be free from afflictions from functional malefics. 
(2)  The conjunction or aspect responsible for the Raaja  Yoga should be close (say, 
within 6 ° or so). 
If Mercury and Venus are at 2 ° and 26 ° in Ta for a native with Cp lagna, for 
example, their conjunction brings a Raaja Yoga (Dha rma-Karmadhipati Yoga in 
particular). However, the two planets are too far apart for this yoga to give its full 
results. They are still associated, but the associa tion is not very strong. If Venus 
is at 3 ° in Ta in instead of 26 °, the conjunction is very close and the yoga can 
give its full results, if other factors are favorable. 
 
(3)  The two planets should not be combust, debilitated or in an inimical house or in 
bad avasthas (states). 
 
Any blemishes here will considerably reduce the mag nitude of the yoga. In addition 
to the above factors, Sage Parasara recommended loo king at the amsas occupied by 
the 2 planets as per Dasa Varga (ten division) sche me. Count the divisional charts – 
out of the ten charts of Dasa Varga scheme – in whi ch a planet occupies an own, 
exaltation or moolatrikona sign. Based on the count  of divisional charts with such a 
good placement for the planet in question, we say t hat it is in a particular amsa. 
Please see the chapter “Divisional Charts” for details. 
 
If the two planets giving raaja yoga have a count o f one or zero, the yoga is ordinary 
and gives good results depending on the factors already outlined. 
 
If the two planets are in Paarijaataamsa (count of 2), then one becomes a king who 
rules his people well. If the two planets are in Ut tamsaamsa (count of 3), then one 
becomes a good king with tremendous assets. If the two planets are in Gopuraamsa 
(count of 4), then one becomes a great king respected by many kings. 
 
If the two planets are in Simhaasanaamsa (count of 5), then one becomes a great 
emperor who rules the whole world. Parasara said th at several great emperors of

Indian mythology – like Harischandra, Manu, Bali, V aiswaanara, Yudhisthira (also 
known as Dharmaraja) and Saalivaahana 36  – were born with this combination. 
 
Two planets giving Raaja Yoga can be in Paaraavataamsa (count of 6), Devalokamsa 
(count of 7), Brahmalokaamsa (count of 8) and Airaa vataamsa (count of 9) only for 
divine persons such as Svaayambhuva Manu (Manu who was born by Himself), 
Brahma (Creator!!) and Vishnu’s incarnations such as Sri Rama and Sri Krishna. 
 
Final Judgment: None of the above factors influences the end result  completely. 
We should look at all the factors and make the final judgment. 
 
Chart 10 
 
 
India’s former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
37  had lagna lord Sun and 5 th  lord Jupiter 
in lagna giving a Raaja Yoga. Both were in Simhaasa naamsa. However, they were 
                                                 
36  Saalivaahana was yet to be born when Parasara wrot e his classic “Brihat Paaraasara Horaa 
Saastram”. He referred Dharmaraja of Mahabharata as  “King Yudhisthira of this Yuga” and made a 
prediction about the birth of Saalivaahana with Raaja Yoga giving planets in Simhaasanaamsa.

more than 8 ° apart 
38  and functional malefics were with them. Saturn had  a very close 
aspect on Jupiter. So the Yoga is pretty weak. Howe ver, the two planets are in 
Simhasanamsa and that raises the level of the Yoga.  In the end, he only became 
India’s prime minister and not an “emperor of the whole world”. 
 
Let us look at India’s emperor Akbar 
39  (see Chart 10). His chart has Libra lagna. 
Lagna lord Venus and 4 th  and 5 th  lord Saturn are in lagna. They give Mahapurusha 
yogas (Maalavya and Sasa) as well as a Raja Yoga. M oon and Mercury own 10 th  and 
9th  and they have a close aspect. They also form a Raj a Yoga. But they are not even 
in Paarijaataamsa. Venus and Saturn are only in Uttamaamsa and Paarijaataamsa. 
 
However, Venus and Saturn are very strong and take part in other Yogas. Both the 
Raja Yogas are very close. Venus and Saturn are les s than a degree apart. They are 
afflicted by a functional malefic (Jupiter), but Ju piter is 22 ° away from them. 
Moreover, lord of GL is Mars and he gives another M ahapurusha Yoga – Ruchaka 
Yoga – and he is in Simhasanamsa. 
 
Due to all these reasons, Akbar was a great emperor  of India although Raja Yoga 
giving planets weren’t in Simhaasanaamsa. We should  always make the final 
judgment after looking at all the factors. 
 
11.7.3  More Raja Yogas 
 
Some advanced Raaja Yogas will be listed below. 
 
(1)  If ( a) chara putra karaka (PK) and chara atmaka karaka ( AK) are conjoined and 
(b) lagna and 5 
th  lords conjoin, then Raaja Yoga is present and the native 
enjoys power and prosperity. If only one condition is satisfied, still the results 
may be felt, but not fully. 
(2)  If ( a) lagna lord is in 5 th , ( b) 5 th  lord is in lagna, ( c) AK and PK are in lagna or 
the 5 th  house, and ( d) those planets in owns rasi or amsa or in exaltati on or 
aspected by benefics, then this yoga is present and  the native becomes a great 
king (Maharajah) loved by his associates. 
                                                 
38  Anything greater than 5 or 6 degrees is too large for a Raaja Yoga to give its full results. 
39  Birthdata: December 4, 1542, 3:39 am (LMT), 69 E 4 7, 25 N 19. This date may be written by some 
as November 24, 1542 based on the old calendar.

 138 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(3)  If the 9 th  lord and AK are in lagna, 5 th  or 7 th , aspected by benefics, then Raaja 
Yoga is present. 
(4)  If the 2 nd , 4 th  and 5 th  houses from lagna lord and AK are occupied by bene fics, 
one becomes a king. 
(5)  If the 3 rd  and 6 th  houses from lagna lord and AK are occupied or aspe cted by 
malefics, one becomes a king. 
(6)  If lagna, HL and GL are joined or aspected by the s ame planet, then that planet 
gives a Raaja Yoga. One may add “owned” to “joined or aspected”. 
Planets aspecting or joining HL and GL give wealth and power respectively. If 
such a planet is associated with lagna also, its potential to do good increases. 
Results of this yoga may be experienced if the cond itions are not strictly met, 
but a planet has an association with lagna (or lagn a lord), HL (or HL lord) and 
GL (or GL lord). Association here can mean ownershi p, conjunction or aspect. 
If lagna lord is in HL and aspects GL lord, for exa mple, results of this Raaja 
Yoga may be experienced to some extent.  
(7)  If the same planet aspects lagna in the six divisio nal charts of shad vargas – 
Rasi, Navamsa, Hora, Drekkana, Dwadasamsa, Trimsams a – then that planet 
gives a Raaja Yoga. 
(8)  If lagna, HL and GL are occupied by a planet in own  or exaltation sign, then 
the native becomes a king. [NOTE : It can be different planets.] 
(9)  If lagna in Rasi, Navamsa and Drekkana charts is oc cupied by a planet in own 
or exaltation sign, then the native becomes a king.  [N OTE : It can be different 
planets.] 
(10)  If ( a) the 3 rd , 6 th  and 8 th  houses are occupied by one or two planets in 
debilitation and ( b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and as pects lagna, 
it forms a Raaja Yoga. 
(11)  If ( a) the 6 th , 8 th  and 12 th  lords are debilitated or combust or in inimical si gns 
and ( b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and as pects lagna, it forms a 
Raaja Yoga.

(12)  If the 5 
th  and 9 th  lords are in a conjunction or a mutual aspect, it makes one 
prosperous. 
(13)  If ( a) the 4 th  lord is in the 10 th  house and the 10 th  lord is in the 4 th  house and ( b) 
both of them are aspected by the 5 th  lord or the 9 th  lord, then a Raaja Yoga is 
formed. 
(14)  If ( a) the 5 th  lord is in the 1 st , 4 th  or 10 th  house and ( b) lagna lord or the 9 th  lord 
joins him, then the native becomes a king. 
(15)  If ( a) Moon is strong and occupies vargottamamsa 40  and ( b) four or more 
planets aspect him, then one becomes a king. 
(16)  If 4 or more planets occupy moolatrikonas or exalta tion signs, one becomes a 
king even if he is from a lowly family. 
(17)  If benefics are in quadrants and malefics are in th e 3 rd , 6 th  and 11 th  houses, one 
becomes a king even if he is from a lowly family. 
(18)  If  arudha lagna and darapada (arudha pada of the 7 th  house) are not  in mutual 
2nd /12 th  or 6 th /8 th  positions, then Raja Yogas in the chart will be more effective. 
 
11.8  Raaja Sambandha Yogas 
 
Raaja means a king. Sambandha means relation or ass ociation. Raaja sambandha 
yogas are the combinations that give association wi th rulers. Those who have thse 
yogas are typically powerful ministers, secretaries , counsellors and bureaucrats, 
associated with the rulers and powerful men. Howeve r, these yogas are very 
common. The magnitude of success depends on the str ength of the planets involved 
in raja yoga. 
 
(1)  If the 10 
th  lord is conjoined or aspected by AmK (chara amaatya kaaraka) or his 
dispositor, one becomes an important person in the court of a king. 
                                                 
40  A planet is in vargottamaamsa if it occupies the same sign in Rasi and Navamsa charts.

(2)  If the 11 th  lord aspects the 11 th  house and there are no malefic planets joining or 
aspecting the 10 th  and 11 th  houses, one becomes an important person in the 
court of a king. 
(3)  If AK (chara aatma kaaraka) and AmK conjoin, one is  very intelligent and 
becomes a minister. 
(4)  If AmK is very strong in own sign or his exaltation sign, then also one becomes 
a minister. 
(5)  If AmK is in a trine from lagna, one becomes a famous minister. 
(6)  If AmK is in a quadrant or a trine from AK, one is an associate liked by a king. 
(7)  If malefics occupy the 3 rd  and 6 th  houses from lagna, AL and AK, then one 
becomes a powerful chief of army. 
(8)  If AK is in an own or exaltation sign in a quadrant  or a trine and the 9 th  lord is 
conjoined or aspected by AK, one becomes a minister. 
(9)  If AK happens to be Moon’s dispositor and he occupi es lagna along with a 
benefic, one becomes a minister at an old age. 
(10)  If AK is in the 5 th ,7 th , 9 th  or 10 th  houses with a benefic, one will be associated 
with kings and earn money thus. 
(11)  If bhagyapada (A9 – arudha pada of the 9 th  house) is in lagna or AK is in 9 th , 
one is fortunate and associates with kings. 
(12)  If the 11 th  lord is in the 11 th  house without aspects from any malefics and AK is 
with benefics, then one has gains from a king. 
(13)  If lagna lord is in the 10 th  house and the 10 th  lord is in lagna, one is powerful 
and associated with kings. 
(14)  If Moon and Venus are in the 4 th  house from AK, one is endowed with royal 
insignia. 
(15)  If lagna lord or AK conjoins the 5 th  lord in a quadrant or a trine, one becomes a 
king’s friend.

11.9  Dhana Yogas 
 
Dhana means wealth. Dhana yogas are combinations that give one abundant riches. 
 
Basic Principle: The 5 
th  and 9 th  lords and planets joining them are capable of givi ng 
money. They give dasas in their dasas. The 11 th  house is also important for material 
gains and it should be strong. The 2 nd  house is also important. If Moon, Mercury, 
Jupiter or Venus is exalted in the 2 nd  house, it makes the native very rich. 
 
In addition to these general principles, Parasara l isted specific combinations for 
various lagnas. In all these combinations, the stre ngth of the participating planets 
decides the magnitude of results experienced. 
 
(1)  For Ar lagna:  If Sun is in the 5 
th  house and Saturn, Moon and Jupiter are in 
the 11 th  house, one becomes very affluent. If Mars occupies  lagna conjoined or 
aspected by Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich. 
(2)  For Ta lagna:  If Mercury is in the 5 th  house and Moon, Mars and Jupiter are in 
the 11 th  house, one becomes very affluent. If Venus occupie s lagna conjoined 
or aspected by Mercury and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich. 
(3)  For Ge lagna:  If Venus is in the 5 th  house and Mars is in the 11 th  house, one 
becomes very affluent. If Mercury occupies lagna co njoined or aspected by 
Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich. 
(4)  For Cn lagna:  If Mars is in the 5 th  house and Venus is in the 11 th  house, one 
becomes very affluent. If Moon occupies lagna conjo ined or aspected by 
Mercury and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 
(5)  For Le lagna:  If Jupiter is in the 5 th  house and Mercury is in the 11 th  house, 
one becomes very affluent. If Sun occupies lagna co njoined or aspected by 
Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 
(6)  For Vi lagna:  If Saturn is in the 5 th  house and Sun and Moon are in the 11 th  
house, one becomes very affluent. If Mercury occupi es lagna conjoined or 
aspected by Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(7)  For Li lagna:  If Saturn is in the 5 th  house and Sun and Moon are in the 11 th  
house, one becomes very affluent. If Venus occupies  lagna conjoined or

(8)  For Sc lagna:  If Jupiter is in the 5 th  house and Mercury is in the 11 th  house, 
one becomes very affluent. If Mars occupies lagna c onjoined or aspected by 
Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich. 
(9)  For Sg lagna:  If Mars is in the 5 th  house and Venus is in the 11 th  house, one 
becomes very affluent. If Jupiter occupies lagna co njoined or aspected by Mars

or aspected by Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 
(12)  For Pi lagna:  If Moon is in the 5 th  house and in the 11 th  house, one becomes 
very affluent. If Jupiter occupies lagna conjoined or aspected by Mars and 
Mercury, then also one becomes very rich. 
 
11.10  Daridra Yogas 
 
One experiences poverty if the following yogas (com binations) are present in one’s 
chart: 
 
(1)  Lagna lord is in 12 
th  and 12 th  lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or aspected b y 
a maraka planet. 
 
NOTE : The 2 nd  and 7 th  houses are maraka (killer houses). Their lords are marakas 
(killers). Any malefics occupying 2 nd  and 7 th  or associating with 2 nd  and 7 th  lords 
also become malefics.  
 
(2)  Lagna lord is in 6
th  and 6 th  lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or aspected b y a 
maraka planet. 

--- Page 155 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 143 
 
 
 
 
(3)  Lagna or Moon is with Ketu. Lagna lord is in 8 
th . A maraka planet conjoins or 
aspects lagna lord. 
 
(4)  Lagna lord is with a malefic in a dusthana (6 
th , 8 th  or 12 th ) and 2 nd  lord is 
debilitated or in an enemy’s sign. Even a royal sci on with this combination 
becomes poor. 
 
(5)  The 5 
th  lord is in 6 th  and 9 th  lord is in 12 th , with aspects from marakas. 
 
(6)  Malefics occupy lagna without 9 
th  and 10 th  lords, aspected or conjoined by 
marakas. 
 
(7)  Lords of the signs occupied by 6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  lords are in 6 th , 8 th  and 12 th  
houses, conjoined or aspected by malefics. 
 
(8)  Lord of the sign occupied by Moon in navamsa is wit h a maraka or occupies a 
maraka house (2 
nd  and 7 th ). 
 
(9)  Lords of lagna in rasi and navamsa are conjoined or aspected by marakas. 
 
(10)  Benefics are in malefic houses and malefics are in benefic houses. 
 
(11)  Planets conjoined by 6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  lords give loss of wealth in their dasas, if 
they are not conjoined or aspected by the lords of trines. 
 
(12)  Mars and Saturn are in 2 
nd  and Mercury doesn’t aspect them. ( Exception : If 
Mercury aspects Mars and Saturn in 2 nd , great wealth is generated.) 
 
(13)  Sun in 2 
nd  is aspected by Saturn. ( Exception : If Saturn doesn’t aspect, Sun in 2 nd  
gives wealth.) 
 
The general principles emerging from the above combinations are: 
 
Dusthanas (6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th ) and their lords are detrimental to wealth. If lag na, lagna 
lord and trine lords are afflicted by them, one may  be poor. Conjunction or aspect of 
marakas clinches the issue. However, conjunction or  aspect of trine lords is a saving 
factor. In addition, the planets in the 2 nd  house and the strength of 2 nd  lord matter.

11.11  Conclusion 
 
A lot of combinations and results have been given i n this chapter. Readers are 
advised to read more literature and practice yogas on real charts. One should be able 
to find with a quick glance the yogas present in a chart. Experience certainly helps 
there. In the rest of this book, we will see some examples of yogas. 
 
When looking at the results ascribed to various yog as, try to fit them in today’s 
world. For example, one with Kamala yoga may not re ally become a king, but 
probably become the Prime Minister of a nation or t he Governor of a state. When 
using yogas in divisional charts, adapt the results  to the matters signified by the 
chart. 
 
All the great results ascribed to some yogas may no t materialize in reality, due to 
weaknesses in them. Unless a yoga is very strong, a ll the results cannot expected. 
Just one yoga cannot make or break a personality, unless it is very powerful. 
 
In the case of yogas with many conditions, partial results may sometimes be 
experienced if all the conditions are not satisfied.

12.  Ashtakavarga 
 
12.1  Introduction 
 
Analyzing a chart and making correct predictions re quires mixing many different 
principles and making fine compromises and judgment s. Sage Parasara said that it is 
difficult for even great Maharshis. In Kali Yuga 
41 , human beings become sinful and 
the sins kill their intelligence. Parasara said tha t the intellectual pygmies of Kali 
Yuga cannot cope with too many complicated principl es and presented ashtakavarga 
as a simple technique that lets them make reasonabl e predictions without much fuss. 
Ashtaka means “consisting of eight” and varga means “a group”. Ashtakavarga is the 
system of analyzing a chart with respect to a group of 8 reference points. 
 
When we analyze the positions of planets with respe ct to lagna, we have the concept 
of good and bad placements. For example, Jupiter in  the 9 
th  from lagna will be well 
placed and Jupiter in the 3 rd  will be badly placed. Mars in the 3 rd  from lagna will be 
well placed and Mars in the 9 th  will be badly placed. 
 
However, lagna is not the only reference point in a  chart. We have Sun and Moon. In 
fact, all the planets serve as reference points in a chart and they represent the sources 
of various energies that are present in a native. B ased on the houses in which 
different planets are placed in transit, they can b e benefic with respect to some 
energy sources and malefic with respect to some. If a transiting planet is benefic with 
respect to more energy sources, then it brings good results. 
 
So ashtakavarga is essentially a system that tells us the benefic positions of lagna and 
seven planets with respect to each other. This can be used to analyze the strength of a 
natal chart, but it is much more important in analyzing transits. 
 
                                                
 
41  As per Vedic science, time is divided into a cycle  of four Yugas that keep repeating. Those are: 
Krita yuga (1,728,000 years), Treta yuga (1,296,000  years), Dwapara yuga (864,000 years) and Kali 
yuga (432,000 years). In Krita yuga, religiousness and virtuosity of human beings is exemplary. It is 
the worst in Kali yuga. It gradually worsens from K rita yuga to Kali yuga. We are currently in Kali 
yuga. It started about 5,000 years back.

12.2  Benefic and Malefic Houses 
 
The benefic and malefic houses for Sun with respect  to all the 8 references are given 
in Table 19.

In Table 19, an entry of 0 denotes a malefic position or a “karana” or a bindu  (dot). 
An entry of 1 denotes a benefic position or a “sthana” or a rekha  (line) 
42 . To 
understand how to read this table, let us go to the  column titled “Merc” in Table 19. 
This shows benefic houses for Sun to occupy, with r espect to Mercury. The 1 st  and 
2nd  houses have 0 and the 3 rd  house has 1. So the first 2 houses from Mercury ar e 
malefic for Sun and the 3 rd  house is benefic for Sun. Table 20-Table 26 give t he 
benefic and malefic houses of Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and 
lagna (respectively). 
 
                                                
 
42  Some astrologers (especially south Indian astrolog ers) use a different notation. They use “bindu” to 
describe a benefic house (1) and “rekha” to describe malefic house (0). Let us follow Parasara.

Readers without a computer program should memorize these tables. To the modern 
reader who is overly dependent on computers, memori zing these tables may seem 
like a daunting task. As our dependency on technolo gy increases, several skills of 
our brain are left either unused or undeveloped and  those skills slowly vanish. 
Computing ashtakavarga by hand is not as difficult as it may seem to be. In fact, 
even today, some people in India compute all the as htakavarga tables by hand in a 
matter of a few minutes. 
 
Example 37: Let us say Venus is in Ge. Find the rasis in which  Jupiter is benefic 
with respect to Venus. 
 
To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic, we should look at Jupiter’s ashtakavarga 
(see Table 23). To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic with respect to Venus, we 
should look at the column of Venus. Only the 2 
nd , 5 th , 6 th , 9 th , 10 th  and 11 th  houses 
have a 1 (rekha – benefic point) against them. Venu s is in Ge and finding these 
houses with respect to Venus, we get Cn, Li, Sc, Aq , Pi and Ar. So Jupiter is benefic 
with respect to Venus in these rasis.

Exercise 18: Consider the rasi chart in Chart 6. Find the rasis  in which Mercury is 
benefic with respect to different planets and lagna. 
 
12.3  Bhinna Ashtakavarga 
 
In this book, we will denote ashtakavarga with AV. We prepare what is known as 
“Bhinna Ashtakavarga” for each planet. It is denote d with BAV. Bhinna means 
“separate”. When preparing the BAV of a planet, we count the number of references 
from which the planet is benefic in each rasi and p ut that count in that rasi. For each 
planet, we prepare a different BAV. Sometimes we ma y simply use the word 
“ashtakavarga” (AV) to represent a BAV. 
 
The count in each rasi is between 0 to 8. It is cal led the number of rekhas (benefic 
points) in that rasi. If a planet is in a sign with  a count of 5, 6, 7 or 8, it means that 
the planet is benefic in that rasi with respect to more references. So the planet is 
favorable. If a planet is in a sign with a count of  3, 2, 1 or 0, it means that the planet 
is malefic in that rasi with respect to more refere nces. So the planet is unfavorable. If 
the count is 4, the planet is neutral. We can use t his analysis in natal charts and also 
transit charts. 
 
Example 38:  Let us go further with Exercise 18 now. After find ing the rasis in 
which Mercury is benefic with respect to various re ferences, let us count the 
references with respect to which Mercury is benefic  in each rasi. From the answer to 
Exercise 18, we see that Mercury is benefic in Ar w ith respect to Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Venus, Saturn and lagna. In other words, M ercury is benefic in Ar with 
respect to 7 references. So we write 7 in Ar. We se e that Mercury is benefic in Ta  
with respect to Sun, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. In other words, Mercury is benefic 
in Ta with respect to 4 references. So we write 4 i n Ta. We find the count of 
references for each rasi and prepare a chart. This is called Mercury’s BAV or simply 
Mercury’s AV. Readers may complete the calculations and verify with Chart 11. 
 
In Ar and Ge, we have 7 rekhas. So Mercury is benef ic in those rasis with respect to 
7 references out of 8. In Aq, we have 6 rekhas. So these three rasis are particularly 
favorable for Mercury. In Vi and Cp, we have 3 rekh as and that is the lowest. So 
Mercury is particularly unfavorable in Vi and Cp. W e can use this information to 

--- Page 164 ---
  
 
 152 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
interpret how favorable Mercury is in the natal cha rt or in a transit chart. Here 
Mercury is in Ge in the natal chart and Ge has 7 re khas in Mercury’s AV. That 
means that Mercury is a very favorable planet. Bein g the lagna lord and being in a 
quadrant from lagna in own sign ( i.e.  Bhadra yoga) makes him even stronger. 
Because of this, Mercury is extremely favorable in this chart. No wonder Sri P.V. 
Narasimha Rao is a brilliant scholar, well versed i n many languages. He is an 
excellent writer and he won a prestigious literary award for a literary work in a 
language that is not his mother tongue. 
 
Chart 11 
 
 
Exercise 19: Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in the BAVs of Sun, Moon, 
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn for the same rasi chart (see Chart 6). 
 
12.4  Samudaaya Ashtakavarga 
 
Samudaaya means “group”. Samudaaya Ashtakavarga is nothing but the sum of the 
ashtakavargas of seven planets. In each rasi, we ad d the number of rekhas in the 

--- Page 165 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 153 
 
 
 
BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus an d Saturn. The sum denotes 
the number of rekhas in that rasi in Samudaaya Ashtakavarga. It will be denoted with 
SAV. It is also called “Sarva Ashtakavarga” (sarva = all). 
 
Let us continue with the rasi chart in Chart 6. Fro m the answer to Exercise 19, we 
see that the BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupi ter, Venus and Saturn have 5, 
3, 4, 7, 4, 8 and 3 rekhas in Ar (respectively). Ad ding them all, we get 34. So SAV 
has 34 rekhas in Ar and we write 34 in Ar. We can f ind the number of rekhas in all 
the rasis in the same manner and prepare a chart with the number of rekhas written in 
each rasi. 
 
Exercise 20:  Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in SAV for the same rasi 
chart (see Chart 6). 
 
A rasi with 30 or more rekhas becomes strong. Matte rs signified by the house falling 
in such a rasi flourish and planets transiting in s uch a rasi bring good results. A rasi 
with 25-30 rekhas is average. A rasi with less than  25 rekhas becomes weak. Matters 
signified by the house falling in such a rasi suffer and planets transiting in such a rasi 
bring bad results. 
 
When choosing muhurtas 
43  for auspicious activities like a wedding or 
housewarming, one should look at the strengths, as per SAV of the natal chart, of the 
rasis containing lagna, Moon and Sun in the muhurta  chart. Rasis containing 30 or 
more rekhas in SAV are favorable. 
 
12.5  Divisional Charts 
 
There is a misconception that ashtakavarga is appli cable only to rasi charts. Parasara 
does not say it. Parasara lists the divisional char ts in which different areas of life are 
seen, at the very beginning of BPHS. So all the ana lysis in the rest of his classic 
applies to all the divisional charts, unless Parasa ra explicitly mentions rasi chart. For 
example, Parasara says that D-12 shows matters rela ted to father. So any principles 
based on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas that let us  predict matters related to father 
                                                
 
43  Muhurta is an auspicious pre-set time at which one begins important activities. 

--- Page 166 ---
  
 
 154 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
must use D-12. This is a logical deduction and Para sara does not have to mention it 
explicitly each time. 
 
If we can judge the benefic positions of various pl anets with respect to 8 references 
in rasi chart, there is no reason why we should not do it in all the divisional charts. In 
fact, this becomes invaluable when we interpret tra nsits in rasi chart with respect to 
the natal positions in divisional charts and transi ts in divisional charts with respect to 
the natal positions in rasi chart. 
 
Ashtakavarga of divisional charts is prepared in th e same manner as that of rasi 
chart. The benefic houses for each planet with resp ect to the 8 references are the 
same. We can apply the same rules and find the BAVs  of all planets. In fact, we can 
find SAV of a divisional chart too. 
 
Example 39: Let us consider the rasi chart and D-10 of India’s  Prime Minister Sri 
A.B. Vajpayee (see Chart 3 for birthdata). 
 
Readers may find SAV of rasi and D-10 and verify the following: 
 
SAV of Rasi chart: 
 
         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi  
Rekhas   29 22 27 29 28 38 29 26 23 34 28 24  
 
SAV of D-10 chart: 
 
         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi  
Rekhas   23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30  
 
In rasi chart, the 11 
th  house has the maximum number of rekhas (38) showin g 
excellent gains. The 3 rd  house of communication has 34 rekhas. With the sig nificator 
of communication Mercury and the artistic Moon in t he 3 rd  house, he is an excellent 
communicator, great orator and poet. Though Sri Vaj payee’s career wasn’t a bed of 
roses – he struggled in the opposition parties for most of his career – he finally 
became India’s Prime Minister and one must agree th at he had a very successful 
career. He is known as a man of great character. Wi th lagna and the 10 th  house in the 
SAV of rasi chart containing only 26 and 28 rekhas – which is just average – why 
did he have such a successful career? 

--- Page 167 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 155 
 
 
 
 
The answer lies in the SAV of D-10. Lagna in D-10 i s Sc and it contains 35 rekhas – 
maximum in D-10’s SAV. Arudha lagna also contains m ore than 30 rekhas. These 
factors explain his success and good name. The 3 
rd  house in D-10 also has more than 
30 rekhas – like in the rasi chart – and that incre ases the chance of being an excellent 
communicator in public life. Though D-10 is powerfu l with lagna and arudha lagna 
containing more than 30 rekhas, one may notice that  the 8 th  house in D-10 (Ge) has 
33 rekhas in D-10’s SAV. This explains the struggle in Vajpayee’s career. 
 
Chart 12 
 
 
Exercise 21:  Consider the D-10 chart of a lady, shown in Chart 12. Compute the 
SAV of this D-10. Suppose we are told that she has an unsuccessful career as a 
waiter in a small restaurant. Based on D-10’s SAV, does it make sense? If not, guess 
her career. [HINT : Look at the number of rekhas in lagna and the 10 th  house.]

12.6  Prastaara Ashtakavarga 
 
Using the Bhinna Ashtakavarga (BAV) of a planet, we  can find out the rasis in 
which it is benefic with respect to more references and the rasis in which it is malefic 
with respect to more references. To interpret trans its, this is sometimes not enough. 
For example, if we know that a planet is benefic in  Ta with respect to 5 references, 
that may not be enough. We may need to know exactly  what those 5 references are. 
If we are looking for Jupiter’s transit that brings marriage, for example, we may want 
Jupiter to be benefic in his transit rasi with resp ect to certain planets (Venus or DK 
or 7 
th  lord in navamsa, for example). In such situations,  we need to know exactly 
which references a planet is benefic from. 
 
For this purpose, we prepare “Prastaara Astakavarga ”. It will be denoted with PAV. 
Prastaara means “spread-out”. PAV is a spreadsheet that shows the exact references 
from which a planet is benefic in a rasi. We prepar e one PAV for each planet. 
Different people may represent PAV differently. Som e people may cast a chart and 
write the list of benefic references in each rasi. For some people, the answer to 
Exercise 18 may qualify as Mercury’s PAV. Some peop le may prefer to represent 
the same information as shown in Table 27. 
Table 27: Mercury's PAV for Exercise 18

(BAV) 7 4 7 4 4 3 4 4 4 3 6 4 
 
The basic purpose of a planet’s PAV is to show the references with respect to which 
the planet is benefic in each rasi. 
 

--- Page 169 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 157 
 
 
 
N
OTE : From PAV, we can construct BAV easily. From Table  27, we may note that 
the sum of all the entries in each column – rasi – in a PAV gives the number of 
rekhas in that rasi in BAV. This is shown in the last row. 
 
12.7  Sodhya Pindas 
 
We discussed the computation of BAV before. By appl ying some reductions on the 
values in BAV, we get “Sodhita Ashtakavarga” (SoAV) . Using it, we find Sodhya 
Pindas of different planets. These pindas are very important in predicting key events 
and we will talk about them again in the part “Transit Analysis”. 
 
12.7.1  Trikona Sodhana (Trinal Reduction) 
 
Consider the BAV of a planet. Look at different set s of mutual trines separately ( e.g.  
First set: Ar, Le and Sg, Second set: Ta, Vi and Cp ) and apply the following rules on 
each set: 
 
(1)  If atleast one rasi has zero, no reduction is necessary. 
44  
(2)  If the three rasis have the same value, make them all zero. 
(3)  Take the lowest value out of the three. Subtract it from all the values. 
 
Example 40: As an example, let us take Mercury’s BAV given in Chart 11. Let us 
takes fiery trines. Ar, Le and Sg have 7, 4 and 4 rekhas. Rules (1) and (2) don’t apply 
and we go to (3). The lowest value is 4. Subtracting it from the three values, we write 
3, 0 and 0 in Ar, Le and Sg respectively. Let us ta ke the watery trines now. Cn, Sc 
and Pi have 4 rekhas each. Rule (2) applies and we write zero in all the three rasis. 
Readers may carry out the reduction for the remaini ng two sets of trines and verify 
that we get the following table after Trikona Sodhana: 
 
         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi  
Mercury   3  1  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2  0  
                                                 
44  Some authors suggest that this applies only if the re is zero in exactly one rasi. If two rasis have a  
zero, they suggest making the third one also zero. But this is inconsistent with the spirit of the oth er 
rules. The idea is to subtract the lowest value fro m others. In that sense, (1) and (2) are special ca ses 
cases of (3). The change suggested by these authors is inconsistent with this. Let us follow Parasara.  

--- Page 170 ---
  
 
 158 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
12.7.2  Ekaadhipatya Sodhana (Co-owned Reduction) 
 
After we carry out Trikona Sodhana, we carry out an other reduction on the pairs of 
signs that are owned by the same planet. Ar and Sc are owned by Mars; Ta and Li 
are owned by Venus; Ge and Vi are owned by Mercury;  Sg and Pi are owned by 
Jupiter; and, Cp and Aq are owned by Saturn. We app ly a reduction on these pairs of 
rasis separately, using the following rules: 
 
(1)  If atleast one of the rasis has a zero in it, no reduction is necessary and stop here. 
(2)  If both the rasis are occupied by a planet (or plan ets), again no reduction is 
necessary and stop here. 
(3)  If one rasi is occupied by a planet (or planets) an d the other is empty, then do the 
following: 
(a)  If the empty rasi has a lower value, replace the value with a zero. 
(b)  If the empty rasi has a higher value, replace the v alue with the value in the 
other rasi. 
(4)  If both the rasis are empty, then do the following: 
(a)  If both the rasis have the same value, replace both with zero. 
(b)  If they have different values, replace the higher value with the lower value. 
 
Example 41: Let us continue with Example 40. Let us take Ar and Sc. Sc has zero in 
it and (1) applies. So there is no reduction. In fa ct, (1) applies to all pairs and so all 
the values remain unchanged after Ekaadhipatya reduction. 
 
Example 42: Let us consider some other hypothetical examples t o understand all the 
rules correctly. 
(a)  Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is 
occupied by Mars and Li by Jupiter and Saturn. In t his case, rule (2) applies and 
we do not alter the values. 
(b)  Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is 
occupied by Mars and Li is empty. In this case, rul e (3 a) applies and we write 
zero in Li, as Li is empty and it has a lower value than Ta. 

--- Page 171 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 159 
 
 
 
(c)  Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is 
empty and Li is occupied by Jupiter and Saturn. In this case, rule (3 b) applies and 
we write 2 in Ta, as Ta is empty and it has a higher value than Li. 
(d)  Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trik ona reduction. Let us say Ta 
and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4 b) applies and we replace the higher value 4 
with the lower value 2. So we write 2 in Ta. 
(e)  Let us say Ta and Li have 2 and 2 rekhas after Trik ona reduction. Let us say Ta 
and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4 a) applies and we write zero in Ta and Li. 
 
12.7.3  Sodhya Pindas 
 
After carrying out Trikona sodhana and then Ekaadhi patya sodhana on the BAV of a 
planet, we get the “Sodhita Ashtakavarga” of that p lanet. We denote Sodhita 
Ashtakavarga with SoAV. 
45  From it, we find “Sodhya Pinda” of each planet. Th is 
will be used in transit analysis. 
 
For each rasi, we multiply the number in that rasi in SoAV with the multiplier of that 
rasi (shown in Table 28). We find such a product fo r all the 12 rasis. We find the 
sum of the products of all the 12 rasis and the sum is called rasi pinda. 
 
For each planet, we multiply the number in the rasi  containing that planet with the 
multiplier of that planet (shown in Table 29). We f ind such a product for all the 7 
planets. We find the sum of the products of all the  7 planets and the sum is called 
graha pinda. 
 
Table 28: Multipliers in Rasimana 
Rasi Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Multiplier 7 10 8 4 10 6 7 8 9 5 11 12 
 
                                                
 
45  This chart has several purposes which will not be covered in this book. An example is Vaastu or 
Sthaapatya Veda or the Vedic Science of Architectur e. The direction signified by the rasis containing 
most rekhas in the SoAV of a planet should contain the room in which the activity related to the 
planet takes place. For example, we should look at the SoAV of Venus to decide where bedroom 
should be. We should look Jupiter’s SoAV to decide where money and jewels should be kept. We 
should look at Moon’s SoAV to decide the living roo m (hall). Mercury is important for the study 
room. Sun is important for the pooja room.

Table 29: Multipliers in Grahamana

Multiplier 5 5 8 5 10 7 5 
 
By adding rasi pinda and graha pinda, we get “Sodhy a Pinda” of the planet whose 
SoAV we are working with. 
 
Example 43:  Let us continue with Mercury’s SoAV found in Examp le 40 and 
Example 41. 
 
       Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi  
SoAV:   3  1  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2  0  
 
Rasi Pinda : Product for Ar is 3 
x 7 = 21. Product for Ta is 1 x 10 = 10. Product for 
Ge is 3 x 8 = 24. Product for Aq is 2 x 11 = 22. Product for other rasis is zero, 
because they contain zero and we get zero by multiplying zero with any number. The 
sum of all the products is 21 + 10 + 24 + 22 = 77. So rasi pinda is 77. 
 
Graha Pinda : Sun, Mars and Mercury are in Ge, which has 3 rekh as in SoAV. 
Product of Sun is 3 
x 5 = 15. Product of Mars is 3 x 8 = 24. Product of Mercury is 3 x 
5 = 15. Venus is in Ar, which has 3. Product of Venus is 3 x 7 = 21. Other planets are 
in rasis with zero in them. So the product is zero for them. The sum of all the 
products is 15 + 24 + 15 + 21 = 75. So graha pinda is 75. 
 
We get sodhya pinda of Mercury by adding rasi pinda  and graha pinda. We get 77 + 
75 = 152. So Mercury’s sodhya pinda in this chart is 152. 
 
Exercise 22: Find BAV, SoAV and sodhya pinda of all planets in Chart 7. 
 
12.8  Controversies 
 
With some authors using the term bindu (dot) to den ote a benefic house and the term 
rekha (line) to denote a malefic house – which is t he opposite of what we learnt in 
this chapter – readers may be confused when reading  other books. So they should 
keep in mind that there are different conventions i n vogue. We are following 
Parasara’s conventions in this book. 

--- Page 173 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 161 
 
 
 
 
The above is merely a problem of different naming c onventions. It is not a serious 
issue at all. It is just a matter of getting used t o different nomenclature. But there is 
another issue, which is far more serious. There are  a few inconsistencies between the 
lists of benefic houses of Moon and Venus as given by Maharshi Parasara and the 
great astrologer Varahamihira, who is relatively mo dern, as he belongs to 600 AD. 
These inconsistencies may have arisen due to corruption of texts in time 
46 . 
 
To define a planet’s ashtakavarga, Parasara first g ives the count of references from 
which the planet is malefic in the 1 
st  house and then he lists the references. He does 
the same thing for all houses. So we can crosscheck . As if this isn’t enough, the Sage 
then lists the references from which the planet is benefic. He does it in all the houses 
again. Just as “checksum” values are transmitted in  today’s digital communication 
schemes to provide resilience to transmission error s, the Sage, who normally uses 
words sparingly, takes plenty of care to ensure tha t his teachings on ashtakavarga 
remain difficult to corrupt. To corrupt one house v alue in Parasara’s account of 
ashtakavarga, one has to consciously  re-write the verses in three  different places in a 
consistent fashion. With the direct approach adopted by other authors, one can 
change the table just by changing one word. For exa mple, changing “sukha” 
(comfort – 4 th ) to “suta” (son – 5 th ) changes one value without affecting the meter 
used in the verses. With Parasara’s indirect approa ch, consistent changes in multiple 
places are required for a single value change. So P arasara’s indirect approach is 
superior in corruption resistance. We will follow Parasara in this book. 
 
Just for the information of the reader, the places of conflict will be mentioned below: 
 
(1)  Moon’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benefic in the 9 
th  from Moon and 
malefic in the 9 th  from Mars. As per Varahamihira, Moon is malefic in  the 9 th  
from Moon and benefic in the 9 th  from Mars. 
(2)  Moon’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benef ic in the 2 nd  from Jupiter 
and malefic in the 12 th  from Jupiter. As per Varahamihira, Moon is malefic in the 
2nd  from Jupiter and benefic in the 12 th  from Jupiter. 
                                                 
46  In India, books seldom existed on paper and classi cs were transmitted from one generation to the 
other, mostly by word of mouth. People got the clas sics by heart and recited them to their children an d 
students. Books were written in poetry, using nice meters, to facilitate memorization. 

--- Page 174 ---
  
 
 162 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(3)  Venus’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Venus is benefic in the 4 th  from Mars and 
malefic in the 5 th  from Mars. As per Varahamihira, Venus is malefic i n the 4 th  
from Mars and benefic in the 5 th  from Mars. 
 
The definitions and calculations given in this chap ter strictly follow Parasara for the 
reasons already mentioned. However, readers are wel come to experiment and draw 
their own conclusions. Until authentic and conclusi ve researches are conducted into 
the use of sodhya pindas in the timing of events, w e cannot conclusively resolve the 
above controversy. 
 
Apart from this, there is another needless controve rsy related to ashtakavarga. Some 
people prepare “bhava chakra” or “chalit chakra” us ing Sripathi’s (or Porphyry’s) 
house devision method and use that chart to cast ashtakavarga. If Saturn is at 3º in Vi 
and lagna is at 27º in Le, they are very close and these people argue that Saturn is in 
the 1 
st  house from lagna and not in the 2 nd  house. These people make a bhava chakra 
accordingly and use it in ashtakavarga. However, if  lagna is at 15º in Le, Saturn is at 
3º in Vi and Jupiter is at 27º in Le, they may take  Saturn to be in the 2 nd  house from 
Jupiter. They compute a bhava chakra with multi-sig n houses only with respect to 
lagna and not with respect to all the references us ed in ashtakavarga. So their 
approach is neither here nor there . 
 
The stand of this book is very clear – each bhava ( house) with respect to one 
reference can only be in one rasi. Even if Saturn i s at 1º in Vi and lagna is at 29º in 
Le, we still say that the 1 
st  house is in Le, the 2 nd  house is in Li and Saturn is in the 
2nd  house (though he is only 2º away from lagna). We d o not recognize the house 
division methods of Porphyry and others in this boo k. Each rasi is a house and the 1 st  
house is the rasi containing the reference. Readers  will do well to follow Maharshi 
Parasara and ignore the creations and borrowings of later day Indian astrologers. 
 
12.9  Answers to Exercises 
 
Exercise 18: 
 
See Table 22 for Mercury’s ashtakavarga. Looking at  the columns of different 
planets, find the houses from the planets in which Mercury is benefic. Count those

rekhas. This shows the importance of speech and voi ce in her career. Ghati lagna is 
in Taurus and its lord Venus occupies it. This make s ghati lagna and 9 th  house very 
powerful. This shows a fortunate (9 th ) and famous (GL) entertainer (Venus). Saturn’s 
11 th  house argala on GL suggests popular mass support a s a catalyst in her success. 
Rahu’s unobstructed 2 nd  house argala on lagna shows unconventional behavio r in 
public life. 47

13.  Interpreting Charts 
 
13.1  Introduction 
 
In the previous chapters, we have learnt various pa rameters and tools available in 
Vedic astrology. When it comes to putting them all together and interpreting charts, 
there is no substitute for experience. One should a lso refer to classics and “How to 
Judge a Horoscope” (Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. Raman,  to become familiar with the 
standard results attributed to different planets be ing in different houses and the lords 
of different houses being in various houses. In thi s chapter, we will cover some 
topics not covered yet and go through a couple of e xamples of interpreting charts. 
We will see many more examples in the rest of this book. 
 
13.2  Functional Nature 
 
We learnt that Jupiter, Venus, waxing Moon and well -associated Mercury are natural 
benefics. We learnt that Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, K etu, waning Moon and ill-
associated Mercury are natural malefics. In additio n, we have the concept of 
functional benefics and functional malefics . 
 
The lords of trines from lagna are functional benef ics. The lords of 3 
rd , 6 th  and 11 th  
are functional malefics. The lord of a quadrant is a functional malefic if he is a 
natural benefic and functionally neutral if he is a natural malefic. The lords of 2 nd , 8 th  
and 12 th  are functionally neutral. Of these, the 8 th  house is more malefic than the 
other two. 
 
Planet owning a quadrant and a trine becomes a yogakaraka (excellent planet). 
 
In the case of planets owning two rasis, we need to  judiciously combine the two 
indications. The list of yogakarakas, functional be nefics, functional neutrals and 
functional malefics for each lagna is given in Tabl e 30. Moon is not listed for 
movable rasis, because his functional nature depend s on whether he is waxing or 
waning. Waxing Moon is a natural benefic and he bec omes a functional malefic with 

--- Page 179 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 167 
 
 
 
quadrant ownership. Waning Moon, on the other hand,  is a natural malefic and 
quadrant ownership makes him functionally neutral.

A functional benefic is a favorable planet in a cha rt. Placement of a functional 
benefic in quadrants (sustenance) and trines (prosp erity) brings good results. 
Placement of a functional malefic in these houses i s not good, unless it is very 
strong. A functional malefic placed in the 3 
rd  house and dusthanas (6 th , 8 th  and 12 th  
houses) brings good results, by spoiling the significations of the bad houses. 
 
If a planet aspects or conjoins or owns HL and lagna, it becomes a yogada (giver of 
yoga) in money matters. If a planet aspects or conj oins or owns GL and lagna, it 

--- Page 180 ---
  
 
 168 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
becomes a yogada in the matters of power and author ity. Irrespective of their 
functional nature, planets that become yogada bring  goodluck. Similarly, planets 
involved in important yogas also bring good luck. 
 
We should consider the inherent nature and the func tional nature of planets. Whether 
a planet is a natural benefic or a natural malefic is analogous to whether a person is 
inherently good or bad. Whether a planet is a funct ional benefic or a functional 
malefic is analogous to whether a person does good or bad to one. Just as a nice 
person may harm one and a bad person may do good, n atural benefics can become 
functional malefics and natural malefics can become functional benefics. 
 
13.3  Baadhakas 
 
For a house falling in a movable/fixed/dual rasi, t he 11 
th /9 th /7 th  house (respectively) 
from there becomes baadhaka sthaana (troubling spot ). Its lord is called a 
“baadhaka” (troublemaker) for the original house. T he list of baadhaka sthaanas and 
baadhakas corresponding to each rasi is given in Table 31. 
 
For example, suppose lagna in someone’s D-10 is in Ge. Then Jupiter is baadhaka 
for lagna. The periods of Jupiter and planets in Sg  can create some obstructions and 
troubles in career. Let us take another house. Aq i s the 9 
th  house and the 9 th  house in 
D-10 shows the guidance one gets in one’s career. I t can show manager and elders 
giving guidance. Baadhaka sthana for Aq is Li. So t he periods of Venus and 
occupants of Li can create some troubles related to  the guidance one gets. There may 
be some troubles related to manager. Thus we can co nsider baadhaka from every 
house and arudha pada in every divisional chart.

13.4  Analyzing Charts 
 
13.4.1  Basic Guidelines 
 
When we analyze the charts, we should remember all the concepts we learnt in the 
previous chapters. The following factors must be remembered: 
 
(1)  Divisional Chart: Use the correct divisional chart for the matter of interest. 
Suppose we are looking at happiness from a vehicle.  D-16 is the best chart. 
Suppose we are trying to analyze a criminal’s psych ology. D-30 is the best chart. 
Suppose we are analyzing marriage. D-9 is the best chart. Suppose we are 
analyzing marriage in a culture where marriage is n ot a dharma (duty) and a 
union of souls, but it is merely living together of  two people, then rasi chart may 
be better than D-9. Suppose we want to study one’s religious activities. Then D-
20 is the chart. If we want to study one’s learning , D-24 is the chart. Suppose we 
want to study one’s career and achievements in soci ety, D-10 chart is the correct 
chart. In this manner, we should choose the correct divisional chart. 
(2)  House: We should choose the correct house after choosing t he correct divisional 
chart. Let us say that we are analyzing someone’s l earning related activities and 
decided to look at D-24. If we want to see his educ ation, we see the 4 
th  house. If 
we want to see his intelligence, scholarship, acade mic reputation, academic 
distinctions/awards, students etc , we should look at the 5 th  house. If we want to 
see how one, in one’s pursuit of knowledge, interac ts with others and what kind 
of people one interacts with, then we should see th e 7 th  house. Like that, we 
choose the correct house for the matter of interest. 
(3)  Reference: We should choose the correct reference for counting  houses. In the 
above example of D-24, academic reputation is relat ed more to the perceived self 
(AL) than the true self (lagna). So it is seen from  the 5 th  from arudha lagna (AL). 
Intelligence and scholarship, on the other hand, ar e related to the true self and 

--- Page 182 ---
  
 
 170 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
they are seen from the 5 th  from lagna. When the relevant karakas are stronger, we 
can use them as references instead of lagna. So sch olarship can be seen from the 
5th  from Mercury. Students can be seen from the 5 th  lord. Intelligence can be seen 
from the 5 th  from Jupiter. Academic reputation can be seen in D -24 from the 5 th  
from Sun. 
(4)  House vs Arudha: Sometimes, an arudha pada is more appropriate to se e a 
matter than a house. For example, we can see darapada (A7) in D-24 to figure out 
what kind of people one typically interacts with in  one’s learning related 
activities. We can see one’s academic distinctions/awards in A5, because they are 
maya (illusion) related to intelligence and scholar ship. The world forms an 
impression about one’s intelligence and scholarship based on one’s scores, ranks, 
grades, distinctions and awards. 
(5)  Influences: After we choose a house/arudha in a divisional char t to represent the 
matter of interest, the next step is to analyze the  influences on it. Planets 
influence it with rasi drishti and graha drishti. W e should also check for argala. 
We should judge the meaning of each influence. We c an also judge the 
influences on a house by finding houses with respect to  that house. Planets in the 
quadrants from a house sustain it. Planets in trine s from a house let it prosper. 
Planets in upachayas let it grow. Planets in dustha nas bring obstacles. Suppose 
we are analyzing A3 in an author’s D-10. While the 3 rd  house shows one’s 
writing skills, it is A3 that shows one’s books. If  a planet is in a quadrant from 
A3, its periods may result in book writing. If a pl anet is in the 8 th  house from A3, 
its periods may bring obstacles in book writing. If  a planet is a baadhaka from 
A3, it can create troubles in book-writing. 
(6)  Standard Results: There are many standard results given in literature for various 
planets and house lords in various houses. These results should be mastered. 
 
Attention should be paid to the strength and avasth as of various planets and 
ashtakavarga strength of various houses. The presence of yogas should also be noted. 
 
13.4.2  Family Members 
 
We can analyze the fortunes of family members from one’s chart. For parents, 
grandparents, uncles and aunts, we should see D-12.  For children, children-in-law 
and grandchildren, we should see D-7. For brothers,  sisters, brothers-in-law and 

--- Page 183 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 171 
 
 
 
sister-in-law, we should see D-3. For spouse and hi s/her family members, we should 
see D-9. 
 
In each of these charts, we should look at the hous e that shows the person of interest 
and consider the rasi containing the lord of that h ouse as lagna. We can consider the 
corresponding arudha pada also. For example, the 9 
th  lord or the arudha pada of 9 th  
house in D-12 shows father. The 4 th  lord or the arudha pada of 4 th  house in D-12 
shows mother. 
 
In D-3, we see siblings. The 3 
rd  house shows younger sibling and the 11 th  house 
shows elder sibling. Being the 3 rd  from the 3 rd  house, the 5 th  house shows younger 
brother’s younger brother, i.e.  second younger brother. Being the 11 th  from the 11 th  
house, the 9 th  house shows elder brother’s elder brother, i.e.  second elder brother. We 
take the 3 rd  lord, 5 th  lord, 7 th  lord etc  as lagnas of first (immediate) younger sibling, 
second younger sibling, third younger sibling etc . We take the 11 th  lord, 9 th  lord, 7 th  
lord etc  as lagnas of first (immediate) elder sibling, second elder sibling, third elder 
sibling etc . 
 
Similarly, the 5 
th  house house shows children in D-7. The 7 th  house is the 3 rd  from 5 th  
and shows one’s child’s younger sibling. So the 5 th  lord shows the first child, the 7 th  
lord shows the second child, the 9 th  house shows the third child and so on. 
 
When we count houses corresponding to siblings and children in D-3 and D-7, we 
count in the forward or backward direction based on  whether lagna is odd or even 
(respectively). If lagna in D-7 is in Ge, Venus (lo rd of Li) shows first child, Jupiter 
(lord of Sg) shows the second child and so on. On t he other hand, if lagna in D-7 is 
in Cn, Jupiter (lord of Pi) shows the first child, Saturn (lord of Cp) shows the second 
child and so on. 
 
N
OTE : After covering all the odd or even signs, we move  from odd to even signs or 
even to odd signs, instead of coming back to where we started. 
 
13.5  Examples 
 
After going through a couple of examples, readers m ay be able to appreciate the 
process of interpreting charts.

 172 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 44: Let us consider the rasi chart given in Chart 13 a nd start making some 
observations. 
 
Lagna in Leo can show someone royal and authoritati ve. Lagna lord Sun is in the 
10 
th  house with 5 th  lord Jupiter. This forms a raaja yoga. With Jupiter in Uttamaamsa, 
this yoga is powerful. Moreover, this yoga takes pl ace in the 7 th  from AL. That 
makes it more powerful. 
 
However, we note that debilitated Moon occupies AL in a Martian sign and Saturn 
aspects him. Debilitated Moon in AL shows that the mind is turned away from the 
material world. Saturn is the significator of hard- work, service and austerity and he 
also signifies renunciation. His aspect on Moon can  give renunciation. Moreover, 
Saturn is with Ketu here. Overall, there are parivr aaja yogas 
48  here. So this native is 
likely to have renounced the world. 
 
                                                
 
48  Parivraaja yogas are combinations that give renunciation of the material world. 

--- Page 185 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 173 
 
 
 
Chart 13 
 
 
Saturn is the planet of hard-work. Ketu is the plan et of selflessness, evolution and 
rising above the shackles of the material world. Venus is the planet of passion. If two 

--- Page 186 ---
  
 
 174 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
of these planets are together and the third planet aspects them, it gives Tapaswi 49  
yoga. If AK (chara atma karaka – soul) also aspects  or conjoins the planets involved 
in Tapaswi yoga, this tapas will be more fruitful a nd will be a continuation of the 
efforts of the past lives (AK is one’s link with the past lives). 
 
Here Saturn and Ketu are together in Virgo and exal ted Venus aspects them from 
Pisces. This gives Tapaswi yoga. Tapaswi yoga is pa rticularly powerful when 
formed with a planet in the 8 
th  house (hard-work, research, discovery and occult 
knowledge). Here Venus is in the 8 th  house. AK is also involved in Tapaswi yoga. 
 
So this native is likely to be a renunciate who did  tapas in something and dedicated 
his life to it. His soul is likely to have found it s purpose in his tapas. However, at the 
same time, there is a powerful rajayoga involving l agna lord and GL lord in the 7 
th  
from AL. That yoga cannot go waste. So this native must’ve enjoyed some power 
and influence in the society. 
 
Let us consider his D-20 now (see Chart 13). D-20 s hows religious and spiritual 
activities. Lagna is in Pisces and lord Jupiter is in the 9 
th  house. This shows 
religiousness and also being guided by a brilliant guru/parampara. GL in D-20 is in 
Sc and Jupiter occupies it. It shows a powerful position in religion. 
 
If the 5 
th  and 9 th  lords conjoin and aspect lagna, we learnt that it forms a rajayoga. 
Here 5 th  lord Moon and 9 th  lord Mars join in Vi and aspect lagna in Pi. This shows a 
powerful rajayoga giving a powerful and prosperous position related to religious 
matters. Venus, the planet of passion, is in the 8 th  house in own rasi. That shows 
sincere efforts and hard-work in religious matters.  The 2 nd  house has Sun and 
Mercury in it. The 2 nd  house shows speech among other things. Mercury is the planet 
of speech and he has 6 rekhas in his D-20 BAV. Sun is a charismatic planet and he 
has 5 rekhas in D-20 BAV. They together give Budha- Aaditya yoga in the house of 
speech. The native is likely to be an excellent orator of religious matters. 
 
This chart belongs to Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswat hi, who was the chief pontiff 
of Kanchi Kama Koti Peetham. He was a great scholar  and a keen student of many 
subjects. He was a true tapaswi and made a Herculea n contribution in restoring the 
place of Vedic knowledge in Indian society. He was a brilliant orator. He  
                                                
 
49  Tapaswi is a person who performs tapas . He forgets everything and pursues something singl e-
mindedly. Tapaswis usually dedicate themselves to r esearch and uncover the secrets of the world. A 
tapaswi can be into yoga, mantra, tantra, astrology or even physics or chemistry.

commanded the respect of presidents, prime minister s, chief ministers and millions

 176 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 45: Let us consider the D-3 chart of Late Rajiv Gandhi (see Chart 14). 
 
Based on his D-3, let us try to say something about  his younger Sanjay Gandhi. 
Lagna in D-3 is in Sg, an odd sign. So we count hou ses normally. The 3 
rd  house is 
Aq. Saturn is its lord and we should take Li as lag na in Rajiv Gandhi’s D-3 to 
analyze Sanjay Gandhi’s fortune. 
 
Lagna has exalted Saturn in it. This shows Sasa yog a. This shows someone with 
many loyal followers. The 10 
th  house has 5 th  lord Rahu. If the 5 th  lord is in 10 th , it can 
show power. Because it is Rahu, it can show forcefu l nature in career. However, the 
10 th  lord Moon is in a fiery sign in the 3 rd  house with Jupiter and Venus, two rank 
benefics. The 3 rd  house shows one’s parakrama (boldness and initiati ve). This shows 
a very positive and pro-active attitude. It shows a doer. 
 
It may be interesting to note the similarities betw een Rajiv Gandhi’s D-3 and Sanjay 
Gandhi’s rasi chart (shown in Chart 14). In both, S aturn is on the lagna axis. In the 
former, Saturn is in lagna and Saturn owns lagna in  the latter. In the former, Moon 
owns 10 
th  and joins Jupiter and Venus. In the latter, Jupite r and Venus are in 10 th , 
aspected by Moon. In the former, 5 th  lord Rahu is in 10 th . In the latter, Rahu is in 5 th  
and aspects 10 th . In the former, Sun is in own sign in 11 th , aspected by Mercury, 
Saturn and Ketu. In the latter, Sun, Mercury and Ke tu are in 11 th  and Saturn aspects 
them. In both, Mars is in the 12 th  house. 
 
Usually, we have such links between the charts of related people. 
 
Example 46: Let us consider the D-24 charts (see Chart 15) and  D-27 charts (see 
Chart 16) of twins Satyam Gaur and Shivam Gaur, who  were born just 2 minutes 
apart. They have the same rasi chart, but Satyam Ga ur was a brilliant student and 
Shivam Gaur was a mediocre student. Satyam studied commerce and accountancy  
and scored well. Shivam was a mediocre student exce pt in mathematics. Satyam is 
jovial, amicable and optimistic. Shivam is a skepti c. He does not believe in astrology 
and always seeks rational explanations. Let us try to explain these facts. 
 
D-24 is the chart that shows education. In Satyam’s  case, lagna is in Li and lagna 
lord Venus is well-placed in a trine in a friendly house. Moreover, the sign occupied 
by lagna lord is Ge, an intellectual sign. Mercury is in the 5 
th  house and that gives 
good memory and intelligence. It also gives skills in commerce and accounting.

Moreover, AL has Mercury and it shows a person who is perceived as an intellectual 
person as far as learning goes. Mars in 6 
th , Venus in 5 th  and nodes in 11 th  are well-
placed from AL. 
 
In Shivam’s D-24, lagna moved to Sc and lagna lord is debilitated. The strength of 
lagna and lagna lord is very important in any chart . Moreover, 5 
th  lord Jupiter is also 
debilitated. Still, exalted Ketu’s aspect on Pi, th e 5 th  house, gave him some skills in 
mathematics. But the debilitation of lagna lord and  5 th  lord makes him a mediocre 
student. From AL also, Mars in 7 th , Venus in 6 th , nodes in 12 th  are badly placed. 
Malefics in 3 rd , 6 th  and 11 th  from AL and benefics in trines from it will give g ood 
results. 
 
To see one’s inherent nature, strengths and weaknes ses, we  should look at D-27. In 
Satyam’s D-27, lagna is in Ge and lagna lord Mercur y aspects it. This gives Bhadra 
yoga like results. The 5 
th  house of emotions and judgment is Libra and its lord Venus 
occupies it. This strength of lagna and 5 th  house made him a very jovial, amicable, 
cheerful and balanced person. 
 
On the other hand, lagna in Shivam’s D-27 is in Cn.  Lagna lord Moon is debilitated 
in the 5 
th  house of emotions. This gives an unhappy spirit. T he 5 th  house shows 
emotions and judgment and the 5 th  lord Mars is in Vi. The 8 th  lord (skepticism) 
Saturn has an aspect with him from Pi. This makes h im skeptical and depressed. 
Mars in taamasik and analytical sign Vi, with an aspect with 8 th  lord, makes him seek 
rational explanations for everything. 
 
13.6  Conclusion 
 
In this chapter, we tried to recapitulate what we l earnt in the previous chapters. A 
couple of examples were given to illustrate the pro cess of interpreting charts. In the 
rest of the book, we will see many more examples.

14.  Topics Related to Longevity 
 
14.1  Introduction 
 
Many human beings are curious about how long they w ill live. An ethical astrologer 
will not scare a client by predicting death, but he  may caution a client gently before 
critical periods and suggest some remedial measures  to ward off an impending 
danger. An estimation of longevity is also helpful in matchmaking. After all, if one 
person will live for 81 years and the other only fo r 36 years, it is not advisable to 
approve a match between those two people. In matchm aking, it is desirable that the 
bridegroom and the bride have comparable longevity. 
 
In this chapter, we will study some basic tools tha t are used in longevity 
determination techniques. There are formulas for de termining longevity, based on 
ashtakavarga. But they do not always work and they will not be covered in this book. 
We will cover the estimation of longevity based on natal chart and dasas. Though 
there are many dasas that help us in timing death, we will cover only Shoola dasa in 
this book. 
 
14.2  Marakas (Killers) 
 
Each chart has some rasis and planets that are call ed marakas (killers). Since death is 
an event relating to the physical existence, rasi c hart is of utmost importance in 
seeing death. Rudramsa (D-11) shows the forces of d eath and destruction and it can 
also give insight into death. D-30 shows one’s evil s and punishment for the evils. 
Death can be a punishment for one’s evils and so we  should look at D-30 also. 
However, the most important chart is the rasi chart. 
 
The 3 
rd  and 8 th  houses are the houses of life.  The 3 rd  house shows the vitality of 
one’s existence and the 8 th  house shows the longevity. The 12 th  house from any 
house shows losses related to the matters signified  by that house. So the 12 th  house 
from these two houses shows death. So the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses are the houses of 
death.  For good longevity, the 3 rd  and 8 th  houses and their lords should be strong and 
the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses and their lords should be weak. 

--- Page 193 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 181 
 
 
 
 
The rasis containing the 2 
nd  and 7 th  houses are called maraka sthanas  (killer 
stations). When we use rasi-ruled dasas that can sh ow death, dasas of these rasis can 
bring death. Lords of the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses are called maraka grahas (killer 
planets). When we use planet-ruled dasas that can s how death, dasas of these planets 
can bring death. 
 
There are other maraka grahas too. If a malefic pla net powerfully conjoins or 
aspects, using graha drishti, the 2 
nd  and 7 th  houses or their lords, then it qualifies as a 
maraka graha. Let us look at an example. Suppose la gna is in Le, Saturn is in Sg and 
Mars is in Ge. Then Saturn is a maraka on account o f owning the 7 th  house (Aq). 
Mars is a malefic and he is in Ge. He aspects the 2 nd  house (Vi, with the 4 th  house 
aspect) and the 7 th  lord (Saturn in Sg – with the 7 th  house aspect). Because of these 
two factors, Mars is a maraka. Let us take another example. Suppose lagna is in Pi, 
Mars is in Ge, Mercury is in Cp and Saturn is in Ar . On account of owning the 2 nd  
and 7 th  houses, Mars and Mercury are marakas. Look at Satu rn. He is in the 2 nd  
house and aspects the 2 nd  lord Mars (with the 3 rd  house aspect) and the 7 th  lord 
Mercury (with the 10 th  house aspect). So Saturn is also a maraka and he m ay in fact 
be a stronger maraka than Mars and Mercury. 
 
When we time one’s death using a dasa, we should lo ok for the involvement of 
maraka sthanas and maraka grahas. We can also use m arakas when timing death 
using the transits of planets.  
 
14.3  Rudra, Trishoola and Maheswara 
 
In Indian mythology, there are eleven Rudras. They are all different forms of Lord 
Shiva. They bring suffering and death to a native. Trishoola or trident is the weapon 
of Lord Shiva. Maheswara is the Supreme form of Lor d Shiva and he gives 
emancipation to the soul. 
 
For every person, there are eleven rasis that repre sent the eleven Rudras. These rasis 
bring suffering related to various areas of life. 
 
Out of all the eleven Rudras, the one who brings su ffering to the physical self is the 
most important one. In each chart, there is one pla net that plays this role. That planet 
is simply called “Rudra”. That planet stands for th e suffering and destruction of the 

--- Page 194 ---
  
 
 182 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
native. There are three rasis designated as Trishoo la rasis and they bring death. Let 
us see the astrological defintions. 
 
Table 32: Eighth House for Rudra Calculation 
Rasi Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
The 8 th  house Sc Ge Cp Sg Cn Aq Ta Sg Cn Ge Cp Le 
 
Rudra  
 
Consider the lord of the 8 
th  house from ( i) lagna and ( ii ) the 7 th  house. Find the 8 th  
house using Table 32 and not in the normal way 50 . The stronger of the two planets 
becomes Rudra. If the weaker planet is afflicted, i t can also become Rudra. We say 
that a planet is stronger if it conjoins more plane ts. If both planets conjoin the same 
number of planets, a planet in exaltation or own ra si is stronger. A planet joining 
exalted planets is stronger. A planet aspected by m any planets (rasi aspect) is 
stronger. Finally, a planet which is more advanced in its rasi is stronger. We find the 
stronger planet in this manner and it becomes Rudra . However, if the weaker planet 
is debilitated or in an inimical sign and conjoined /aspected by malefics like Mars, 
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu, then it becomes Rudra. 
 
Trishoola Rasis  
 
The three trines from the rasi occupied by Rudra in  rasi chart represent the three 
spikes of Shiva’s Trishoola/trident. They are calle d Trishoola rasis. Depending on 
whether a native has short life or middle life or l ong life, one of the three Trishoola 
rasis kills the native during its Shoola dasa. 
 
Maheswara  
 
The lord of the 8 
th  house from AK (chara atma karaka) is called Mahesw ara. AK 
stands for the soul and the 8 th  lord from him stands for the liberation of soul. H e 
represents the channels through which one’s soul strives for liberation. 
 
                                                
 
50  For odd rasis, we count houses zodiacally. For eve n rasis, we count houses anti-zodiacally. For 
Brahma and Vishnu rasis, we use the regular motion.  For Shiva rasis, we use Shiva’s motion. That is 
how Table 32 is constructed. Shiva’s rasis and Shiva’s motion will be discussed in “Narayana Dasa”. 

--- Page 195 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 183 
 
 
 
There are a couple of exceptions: 
 
(1)  If the 8 
th  lord from AK is in own rasi or exaltation rasi, th en take the stronger of 
the 8 th  and 12 th  lords from him. Suppose AK is Mars and he is in Ge . Then the 8 th  
house from AK is Cp and Saturn is Maheswara. Now le t us say that Saturn is 
exalted in Li. From Saturn (Li), Venus owns the 8 th  house (Ta) and Mercury 
owns the 12 th  house (Vi). The stronger of Mercury and Venus beco mes 
Maheswara. 
(2)  If Rahu or Ketu joins AK or the 8 th  from him, then we find the 6 th  lord from AK 
instead of the 8 th  lord. Please note that this is equivalent to takin g the 8 th  lord in 
the anti-zodiacal order. Suppose AK is Mars and he is in Taurus. Then Sg is the 
8th  house from Mars and Jupiter, lord of Sg, becomes M aheswara. Now, suppose 
Ketu is in Ta or Sg. Because of Ketu’s presence, we  find the 6 th  house from Mars 
instead of the 8 th  house. It is Li. Venus owns it and he becomes Maheswara. 
(3)  If Rahu becomes Maheswara, we take Mercury instead.  If Ketu becomes 
Maheswara, we take Jupiter instead. 
 
14.4  The Method of Three Pairs 
 
This method allows us to determine the approximate range of one’s longevity. In this 
method, we look at 3 pairs of planets/mathematical points. In each pair, we look at 
the two planets and see if they occupy a movable or  fixed or dual rasi. Using Table 
33, we look at the longevity category corresponding to the combination. 
 
(1)  Lagna lord and 8 
th  lord (find the 8 th  house and its lord using Table 32) 
(2)  Moon and Saturn 
(3)  Lagna and Horalagna (HL) 
 
Table 33: Longevity Category for Each Pair 
Combination 1 Combination 2 Result 
Fixed + Dual Movable + Movable Long life 
Movable + Fixed Dual + Dual Middle life 
Movable + Dual Fixed + Fixed Short life 
 

--- Page 196 ---
  
 
 184 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Long life means 72-108 years. Middle life means 36- 72 years. Short life means 0-36 
years. We learnt how to find the longevity category corresponding to each pair. Now, 
we should learn how the results of the three pairs can be combined for one final 
result. 
 
If all the three pairs result in the same longevity  category, that will be the combined 
classification. If two pairs give one result and th e third pair gives a different result, 
then the result given by two pairs dominates. Paras ara gave further hints regarding 
this case and suggested finding the maximum longevi ty (paramaayush) of a person 
using Table 34. 
Table 34: Paramaayush Reckoner 
 Two 
Pairs 
Third Pair 
Short life Middle life Long life 
Short life 32 years 64 years 96 years 
Middle life 36 years 72 years 108 years 
Long life 40 years 80 years 120 years 
 
If all the three pairs give three different results  ( i.e.  one giving short life, one giving 
middle life and one giving long life), then we shou ld give preference to the third pair 
of lagna and horalagna. However, if Moon is in lagn a or the 7 
th  house, then the 
second pair of Moon and Saturn should be given preference. 
 
Example 47: Let us say that lagna is in Ta, HL is in Ar, Moon is in Ta, Mercury is in 
Cn, Venus is in Cp, and Saturn is in Ge. 
 
Pair 1 
: Lagna lord Venus is in Cp, a movable rasi. The 8 th  house is in Ge (see Table 
32) and Mercury owns it. He is in Cn, another movab le rasi. Looking for the 
combination “Movable + Movable” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result. 
Pair 2 : Moon is in Ta, a fixed rasi. Saturn is in Ge, a d ual rasi. Looking for the 
combination “Fixed + Dual” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result. 
Pair 3 : Lagna in Ta, a fixed rasi. Horalagna is in Ar, a movable rasi. Looking for the 
combination “Movable + Fixed” in the table, we see that “middle life” is the result. 
 

--- Page 197 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 185 
 
 
 
We see that two pairs indicate long life and one pa ir indicates middle life. So “long 
life” dominates and the native has long life. Using  Table 34, we see that the 
paramaayush for this case is 108 years. 
 
14.5  The Eighth Lord Method 
 
Parasara and Jaimini prescribed another method for estimating the longevity 
category. Find the stronger of lagna and 7 
th  house and take it as the reference. Find 
the 8 th  lord from it and see where he is placed from it. I f he is in a quadrant, long life 
is indicated. If he is in a panaphara, middle life is indicated. If he is in an apoklima, 
short life is indicated. 
 
Example 48: Let us say that lagna is in Ar and Li is stronger than Ar. Then we take 
Li as the reference. The 8 
th  lord is Venus. If Venus is in Li, Cp, Ar or Cn ( i.e.  a 
quadrant from Li), it shows long life. If Venus is in Sc, Aq, Ta or Le ( i.e.  a 
panaphara from Li), it shows middle life. If Venus is in Sg, Pi, Ge or Vi ( i.e.  an 
apoklima from Li), it shows short  life. 
 
Exercise 23: Consider the rasi chart shown in Chart 8. Identify  the maraka planets in 
this chart. Find Rudra, Trishoolas and Maheswara. F inally estimate the longevity 
category of the native using the method of three pairs and the eighth lord method. 
 
14.6  Conclusion 
 
The definitions and methods given in this chapter w ill be useful in timing death 
using dasas. The two methods of outlined here for d etermining the longevity 
category are not infallible. There are some excepti ons not covered in this book. So 
one should not be biased by these calculations. 
 
It is worthwhile to emphasize once more that this k nowledge should not be misused 
for fame or for scaring clients. One should only ge ntly caution clients and prescribe 
remedial measures. Sages have warned that one misusing the knowledge of astrology 
will live in misery and distress.

 186 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
14.7  Answer to Exercise 
 
Exercise 23: 
 
Marakas 
: Jupiter and Venus own the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses. Rahu is in the 7 th  house. 
These three planets are the main marakas. Mercury o wns 8 th  and joins Jupiter and 
Venus. So he may also be considered a maraka. 
Rudra & Trishoola 
: The 8 th  house from lagna is Sg (see Table 32) and its lord  is 
Jupiter. The 8 th  house from Ta (the 7 th  house) is Ge and its lord is Mercury. Mercury 
is stronger, as he is more advanced in his rasi. He  is Rudra. Rudra is in Libra. So 
Trishoola (Destroyer Shiva’s trident) has spikes in Ge, Li and Aq. 
Maheswara : Mercury is AK. The 8 th  from him is Ta. The 8 th  from him has Rahu. So 
we take the 6 th  from Li and get Pi. Its lord Jupiter is Maheswara. 
Method of Three pairs : Lagna lord and 8 th  lord show middle life (fixed+movable). 
Moon and Saturn show middle life (fixed+movable). L agna and horalagna show 
short life (fixed+fixed). So the longevity category is “middle life” (36-72 years). The 
native died at the age of 50 years. 
The Eighth Lord Method 
: Lagna is stronger than the 7 th  house. So let us take Sc as 
the reference. The 8 th  lord from it is Mercury. He is in an apoklima from Sc (12 th ). So 
the result is “short life”. This method did not work here.

15.  Strength of Planets and Rasis 
 
15.1  Introduction 
 
When judging the results given by houses and planet s, we have to judge their 
strength. Sometimes we have to compare the strength  of two planets and see which 
one will dominate. For example, when finding the ar udha pada of a house falling in 
Scorpio, we learnt that we have to take the stronge r of Mars and Ketu as the lord of 
Scorpio. In several rasi dasas, dasas start from th e stronger of lagna and the 7 
th  
house. We need to be able to compare them and judge  which is stronger. A house 
may be influenced by several planets and they may s uggest contradictory results. In 
such a case, we need to decide which influence dominates. 
 
There are different ways of measuring the strengths  of planets and rasis for different 
purposes. We will learn some of them in this section. 
 
15.2  Why Different Strengths 
 
Why do we need different strengths for different pu rposes? Why can’t we use the 
same strength? To understand this, let us consider an analogy. 
 
Suppose X is an engineer. Suppose Y is another engi neer with exactly the same 
background and suppose Y comes to the house of X fo r a few days. Suppose Y 
sleeps in the afternoon and X doesn’t. Suppose it i s 1 pm and Y is ready for his 
afternoon nap. Suppose the two engineers have promi sed a charity in town that they 
would give a big donation together and suppose some one from the charity comes to 
X’s house. Because it is not his house and because he is sleepy, Y is probably not 
going to play a prominent role and X is probably go ing to talk pleasantries and then 
give a check on behalf of Y and himself. The money is both his and Y’s, but X is in a 
better position to handle it. Shadbalas are similar  to this. When two or more planets 
take part in a yoga, the one that is stronger as per shadbala ends up giving the results. 
 

--- Page 200 ---
  
 
 188 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Both X and Y may have to deal with contractors, wor kers and vendors for their 
professional work. If Y has better relations with t he people he deals with, he will be 
more productive at his work as an engineer. Similar ly, strength as per ashtakavarga 
shows the ability of planets to deliver their goods  in harmony with other planetary 
forces at work in a chart. Even if a planet has goo d shadbala, it will be unable to 
deliver its goods if it is at odds with other plane ts in the chart, i.e.  has a low 
ashtakavarga strength. 
 
An engineer who has good relations with workers, ve ndors and contractors related to 
one project may not go along well with people invol ved in another project. In that 
case, he will produce excellent results in the form er project and he may not be 
effective in the latter. Similarly, a planet may have good ashtakavarga strength in one 
divisional chart and poor ashtakavarga strength in another divisional chart. Then it 
will give its results more effectively in the area of life related to the first chart. 
 
Despite good capabilities and potential to get work  done, Y may be unable to get his 
work done if he is depressed about something or if he is absent-minded for some 
reason. If he is in a cheerful state, he may get hi s work done well. Thus the state one 
is in decides one’s final output. Similarly, a plan et must be in a good “avastha” 
(state) to give good results. There are different k inds of states – states related to age, 
states related to alertness, states related to mood and states related to activity. 
 
When one hires an engineer as an employee or when o ne assigns a project to an 
engineer, one is concerned about how effective he w ill be in the project. But suppose 
one is considering the same engineer as a partner i n business. Then his effectiveness 
in a particular project does not matter much. What matters now is how well rounded 
he is. He should have good overall knowledge of various projects. Vimsopaka bala is 
analogous to this. When we consider the overall effectiveness of a planet in one’s 
life, we no longer look at its effectiveness to giv e results in a specific area of life. 
Instead, we look at Vimsopaka bala. It shows the ov erall strength of a planet and its 
ability to play an important role in one’s life (rather than a specific area of life). 
 
If X and Y have to decide who eats a cake first or who gets to drink the only can of 
soft drink left in the refrigerator, they are proba bly not going to argue about it. Their 
qualifications or productivity at work or mental st ate or overall ability are not going 
to matter. For something so trivial, they will prob ably toss a coin or have a friendly 
arm-wrestling or simply do what their friends prese nt in the room suggest. If Y has 
more friends in the room and they say “let Y have i t”, then Y is going to have it. 

--- Page 201 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 189 
 
 
 
Similarly, for trivial things like determining who initiates dasas, antardasas etc , we 
have very simple rules that are different from shad bala, ashtakavarga bala, avastha 
bala, Vimsopaka bala etc . 
 
As it has been emphasized many times in this book, Vedic astrology has a rich 
variety of parameters, tools and techniques. Attemp ting to use various techniques in 
an interchangable manner only leads to confusion. O ne should strive to understand 
the meanings of various parameters and tools and us e the right set of parameters and 
tools for the occasion. Though we have different wa ys of measuring a planet’s 
strength, their meanings are different and accordin gly they are used for different 
purposes. We will learn the most common ones in this chapter. 
 
15.3  Shadbala and Astakavarga Bala 
 
There are six sources of strength – strength due to  placement, strength due to time, 
strength due to directions, strength due to aspects , strength due to motion and 
strength due to inherent nature. Shadbala  is a measure of the strength of a planet 
based on these six sources of strength. Explaining the computation of shadbalas is 
beyond the scope of this book. For the details of i ts computation, one may refer to 
“Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram” by Parasara or “Grah a and Bhava Balas” by Dr. 
B.V. Raman. Most computer software programs give sh adbala, though there are 
minor differences between the definitions used by them. 
 
When two or planets influence the same house or whe n they participate in a yoga, 
then the planet with the highest shadbala is the mo st likely give the results. The 
planet with the strongest shadbala is like a group leader who acts on the group’s 
behalf. 
 
On the other hand, ashtakavarga bala shows how othe r planets support or oppose a 
planet. It does not show how capable the planet is of leading and giving the results of 
a group of planets, unlike shadbala. It shows how c apable a planet is of giving its 
own results, in harmony with other planetary forces. 
 
15.4  Avasthas (States) 
 

--- Page 202 ---
  
 
 190 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Avastha literally means “state”. There are differen t possible states of a planet and we 
will learn them in this section. 
 
15.4.1  State Related to Age 
 
One of the states of a planet has to do with its ag e. Just as a 10-year old child or an 
80-year old man have their limitations and cannot e xecute certain tasks efficiently, a 
planet in childhoos or old age may not be very effective. 
 
Table 35: Avasthas related to age 
In odd rasis In even rasis Avastha Meaning Results 
0º–6º 24º–30º Saisava Child Quarter 
6º–12º 18º–24º Kumaara Adolescent Half 
12º–18º 12º–18º Yuva Youth Full 
18º–24º 6º–12º Vriddha Old Some 
24º–30º 0º–6º Mrita Dead None 
 
A planet at 23º in Cn will be in Kumaara avastha (a dolescence) and it will give half 
of its results. A planet at 19º in Li will be in Vr iddha avastha (old age) and it will not 
be very effective. A planet at 14º in Sg will be in  Yuva avastha (young age) and it 
will give all of its results. A planet at 27º in Pi  will be at Saisava avastha (childhood) 
and it will give one quarter of its results. 
 
One should not be carried away with these avasthas.  Just as there are some child 
prodigies and wizards with wrinkles, a planet can g ive good results irrespective of its 
age-related state. Age is just one of the factors deciding a person’s productivity. 
Similarly, age-related state is just one  of the factors deciding a planet’s effectiveness. 
 
15.4.2  State Related to Alertness 
 
We have 3 alertness-related states of planets: 
 
(1)  A planet in its exaltation rasi or an own rasi is s aid to be in “Jaagrita” avastha 
(awake). It gives full results. 
(2)  A planet in a rasi owned by a neutral) or friendly planet is said to be in “Swapna” 
avastha (dreaming). It gives medium results. 

--- Page 203 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 191 
 
 
 
(3)  A planet in its debilitation rasi or a rasi owned b y an enemy is said to be in 
“Sushupta” avastha (asleep). The results it gives are negligible. 
 
15.4.3  State Related to Attitude and Mood 
 
We have 9 states of planets that are related to attitude and mood : 
 
(1)  A planet in its exaltation rasi is said to be in “Deepta” avastha (bright). 
(2)  A planet in its own rasi is said to be in “Swastha” avastha (doing well, contented, 
comfortable, natural). 
(3)  A planet in a good friend’s rasi is said to be in “Mudita” avastha (delighted). 
(4)  A planet in a friend’s rasi is said to be in “Saanta” avastha (peaceful). 
(5)  A planet in a neutral planet’s rasi is said to be i n “Deena” avastha (sad, 
depressed). 
(6)  A planet in an enemy’s rasi is said to be in “Duhkh ita” avastha (distressed, 
miserable). 
(7)  A planet joined by malefic planets is said to be in  “Vikala” avastha (crippled, 
confused). 
(8)  A planet in a malefic planet’s rasi is said to be i n “Khala” avastha (mischievous, 
scheming). 
(9)  A planet joined closely by Sun is said to be in “Kopita” avastha (angry). 
 
We have 6 additional states of planets that are related to attitude and mood : 
 
(1)  A planet in the 5 
th  house joined by Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu i s said to 
be in “Lajjita” avastha (ashamed). 
(2)  A planet in its exaltation rasi or moolatrikona ras i is said to be in “Garvita” 
avastha (proud). 
(3)  A planet is in an enemy’s rasi or conjoined by enem ies or aspected by enemies or 
conjoined by Saturn, it is said to be in “Kshudhita” avastha (hungry). 
(4)  A planet stationed in a watery rasi and aspected by  enemies without the aspect of 
benefics is said to be in “Trishita” avastha (thirsty).

 192 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(5)  A planet in a friend’s sign, conjoined or aspected by friends and conjoined by 
Jupiter, is said to be in “Mudita” avastha (delighted). 
(6)  A planet conjoined by Sun and aspected by malefics or enemies is said to be in 
“Kshobhita” avastha (shaken, agitated). 
 
Planets give results based on the state they are in . If a house contains planets in 
Kshudhita or Kshobhita avasthas, the significations  of the house are affected. If a 
planet in the 5 
th  house is in Lajjita avastha, there may be losses r elated to progeny. If 
a planet in the 7 th  house is in Kshobhita avastha, there may be loss of spouse.  
 
15.4.4  States Relates to Activity 
 
There are 12 possible states of a planet related to  its activity. This state is the most 
important of all states. For each planet, we use th e following formula to find its 
avastha. 
 
Suppose C is the number of the constellation occupi ed by the planet (1 for Aswini, 2 
for Bharani and so on). Suppose P is the index of t he planet whose avastha we are 
finding (1 for Sun, 2 for Moon). Suppose A is the i ndex of the amsa (navamsa) 
occupied by the planet in its rasi 
51 . Suppose M is the constellation occupied by 
Moon. Suppose G is the ghati running at birth. 52  Suppose L is the rasi occupied by 
lagna (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta and so on). Then we compu te (C x P x A) + M + G + L, 
divide it by 12 and take the remainder. Using the r esulting number as the avastha 
index and referring to Table 36, we find out the avastha of the planet. 
 
Table 36: Sayanaadi Avasthas 
Avastha 
Index Avastha name Meaning 
1 Sayana Lying down, resting 
2 Upavesana Sitting down 
3 Netrapaani Eyes and hands 
                                                 
51  For example, let us say Mercury is in 22Ge14. Each  navamsa has a length of 3 °20' (1/9 th  of 30 °) and 
22 °14' in Ge is in the 7 th  navamsa of Ge (please note that we are not talking  about the rasi occupied by 
the planet in navamsa). Then we use A = 7 for Mercury. 
52  Suppose sunrise was at 6 am and someone was born a t 11 pm. So 17 hours were over. Each hour 
has 2.5 ghatis and 17 hours = 17 x 2.5 = 42.5. So the 43 rd  ghati was running at birth.

After we find the avastha index, we can multiply it  with itself and add the number 
corresponding to the first sound in the first syllable of the name, as found from Table 
37. We can take the remainder when that number is d ivided by 12. Then we can add 
a planetary adjustment to the remainder. We use 5 f or Sun and Jupiter, 2 Moon and 
Mars, 3 for Mercury, Venus and Saturn and 4 for Rah u and Ketu. We divide the sum 
by 3 and take the remainder. This gives the strengt h of the activity. A value of 1 
means “drishti” and medium results. A value of 2 means “cheshta” and full results. A 
value of 3 (or 0) means “vicheshta” and gives very little results. Based on the 
activity-related state of a planet, we can guess th e results given by it. Based on 
whether it is in Cheshta, Drishti or Vicheshta, the  results will be full, medium or 
little. An example will clarify this computation.

Example 49:  Let us take a native born at 5:50 pm (IST) on 4 
th  April 1970 at 
Machilipatnam, India (81E12, 16N15). Let us find th e activity-related states of 
Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for this native. The native’s given name starts with “V”. 
 
Moon is in Poorvabhadrapada, i.e.  the 25 
th  constellation. So M = 25. The native was 
born at 5:50 pm and sunrise was at 6 am. So 11:50 h ours passed since sunrise. In 
minutes, this is 710 minutes. Because a ghati conta ins 24 minutes, this is 29.6 ghatis. 
So the 30 th  ghati after sunrise was running at birth. So G = 3 0. Lagna is in Virgo, the 

--- Page 212 ---
  
 
 200 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
6th  rasi from Aries and so L = 6. The native’s given n ame starts with “V” and the 
number corresponding to this sound is 1. 
 
Mercury : Mercury is at 3Ar08. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1 
st  constellation. So C = 1. 
Because Mercury is the 4 th  planet from Sun, P = 4. Mercury is in the first 1/ 9 th  of Ar 
and so A = 1. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (1 x 4 x 1) + 25 + 
30 + 6 = 65. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 5. From Table 36, we see that 
an avastha index of 5 means “Gamana” avastha (going /on the move). We see that 5 x 
5 is 25. Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 26. Remainder when this is 
divided by 12 is 2. Adding 3 (Mercury’s planetary a djustment), we get 5. When we 
divide it by 3, remainder is 2. It shows “Cheshta”.  So Mercury’s results due to 
“Gamana” avastha are given in full. We see that the  standard results are “visits the 
courts of kings frequently, wealthy”. 
 
Jupiter : Jupiter is at 9Li46. He is in Swaati, i.e. 15 
th  constellation. So C = 15. 
Because Jupiter is the 5 th  planet from Sun, P = 5. Jupiter is in the third 1/ 9 th  of Li and 
so A = 3. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (15 x 5 x 3) + 25 + 30 
+ 6 = 286. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of  10. From Table 36, we see that 
an avastha index of 10 means “Nriyalipsaa” avastha (urge for dance). We see that 10 
x 10 is 100. Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 101. Remainder when 
this is divided by 12 is 5. Adding 5 (Jupiter’s pla netary adjustment), we get 10. 
When we divide it by 3, remainder is 1. It shows “Drishti”. So Jupiter’s results due to 
“Nriyalipsaa” avastha are given only to a medium ex tent. We see that the standard 
results are: “honored by kings, wealthy, learned in  dharma sastra and tantra, revered 
by powerful men, respected by learned men, a schola r and faultless in grammar and 
etymology”. 
 
Venus : Venus is at 7Ar55. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1 
st  constellation. So C = 1. Because 
Venus is the 6 th  planet from Sun, P = 6. Venus is in the third1/9 th  of Ar and so A = 3. 
Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (1 x 6 x 3) + 25 + 30 + 6 = 79. 
Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 7. From Ta ble 36, we see that an avastha 
index of 7 means “Sabhaa” avastha (assemby/council) . We see that 7 x 7 is 49. 
Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 50. R emainder when this is divided 
by 12 is 2. Adding 3 (planetary adjustment of Venus ), we get 5. When we divide it 
by 3, remainder is 2. It shows “Cheshta”. So Venus’s results due to “Sabhaa” avastha 
are given in full. We see that the standard results  are “eminent in a king’s court, 
virtuous, destroyer of enemies, wealthy and charitable”.

Exercise 24: Consider a gentleman born at 8:30 am (LMT) on 8 
th  November 1927 at 
67E03, 24N52. Find the activity-related states of S un, Mars and Jupiter and interpret 
them. His name starts with the sound “L”. 
 
Importance of Sayanaadi Avasthas: 
 
Sayanaadi (Sayana etc ) avasthas are the most important of all avasthas. In addition to 
the results listed above, Parasara listed some spec ial results. If a benefic is in Sayana 
avastha, the house benefits from his presence. If a  malefic is in Nidraa avastha in the 
7
th  house without the conjunction or aspect of another  malefic, it is auspicious. If a 
malefic is in Bhojana avastha, the house containing  it is destroyed. If a malefic is in 
the 5 th  house in Sayana or Nidraa avastha, it is auspiciou s. If a malefic is in the 8 th  
house in Sayana or Nidraa avastha, it brings death by royal wrath. If a malefic 
occupies the 10 th  house in Bhojana or Sayana avastha, all kinds of m iseries may be 
expected. If a benefic or a planet in own or exalta tion rasi occupies in the 1 st , 5 th , 7 th  
or 10 th  house in Prakasana, Nrityalipsaa or Kautuka avasth as, it brings Raja Yoga. 
Parasara specifically mentioned Moon in the 10 th  house in Kautuka or Prakaasana 
avasthas. 
 
However, one should not be carried away with avasthas and one should remember 
that they are only the “states” of the planet. The state of a planet related to age, 
alertness, mood and activity will have a role in th e results given by it, but the houses 
influenced by it in various divisional charts are m ore important in deciding the 
results. We should avoid the temptation to make pre dictions based on thumbrules 
and look-up tables. 
 
15.5  Other Simple Strengths 
 
15.5.1  Stronger Co-Lord 
 
When we find the arudha pada of a house falling in Scorpio or Aquarius, we need to 
find the stronger of Mars & Ketu (co-lords of Sc) a nd Saturn & Rahu (co-lords of 
Aq). The stronger lord acts its lord and decides th e arudha pada. The stronger lord of 
Sc (or Aq) is also used in finding the duration of its dasa in many rasi dasas ( e.g.  
Narayana dasa). 

--- Page 214 ---
  
 
 202 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Basic rule : If one of the co-lords is in the rasi, take the o ther planet. For example, if 
Saturn is in Aq and Rahu is in a rasi other than Aq , Rahu becomes the primary lord 
of Aq. If not, we find the stronger of the 2 planet s and the stronger planet becomes 
the primary lord. 
 
The stronger planet of two planets is determined us ing the following rules. We go 
from one rule to the next, only if we do not have a  winner. If we have a winner in 
one step, we do not go through the remaining steps. 
 
(1)  If one planet is joined by more planets than the ot her, it is stronger. Suppose 
Saturn is in Pi with Mars and Sun and Rahu is in Ar  with Jupiter. Then Saturn is 
stronger than Rahu, because he is with 2 planets an d Rahu is only with one 
planet. So Saturn becomes the primary lord of Aq. 
(2)  We find how many of the following planets conjoin/a spect a planet: (1) Jupiter, 
(2) Mercury, and, (3) dispositor. A planet conjoine d/aspected by more of these 3 
planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here.  Suppose Saturn is in Ge with 
Mercury, Rahu is in Ar, Mars is in Le, Jupiter is i n Ta. Saturn is conjoined by 
Mercury and his dispositor (who is Mercury again). His count is 2. Rahu in Ar is 
aspected by Mars, his dispositor, from Le. Neither Jupiter nor Mercury aspects or 
conjoins Rahu. So Rahu’s count of 1 loses to Saturn ’s count of 2 and Saturn is 
the stronger planet. He becomes the lord of Aq. 
(3)  If one planet is exalted and the other not, then th e exalted planet is stronger. 
Suppose Saturn is in Li and Rahu is in Cn, with the  same number of planets. 
Suppose we have a tie after step (2). Then we note that Saturn is exalted in Li 
and declare him as the stronger planet. He becomes the primary lord of Aq. 
(4)  If we have a tie after (3), we consider the natural  strength of the rasi containing 
the planet. Dual rasis are stronger than fixed rasi s and fixed rasis are stronger 
than movable rasis. Suppose Mars is in Ge and Ketu is in Aq and we have a tie 
between them after step (3). Then we declare Mars a s the stronger planet and the 
primary lord of Sc, because he is in a dual rasi and Ketu is in a fixed rasi. 
(5)  (a) When finding dasa duration : If we have a tie after (4), we take the planet 
giving a larger length for dasa. Supose Saturn is i n Ge and Rahu is in Vi and 
suppose we have a tie after (4). Suppose we want to  find the stronger lord for 

--- Page 215 ---
 
 
 Part 1: Chart Analysis 203 
 
 
 
Narayana dasa. Rahu in Vi gives 5 years and Saturn in Ge gives 8 years 
53 . So 
Saturn is used instead of Rahu. 
(b) When finding the lord for arudha padas etc : If we have a tie after (4), we take 
the planet that is more advanced in its rasi. We me asure the advancement of 
Rahu and Ketu from the end of the rasi. Suppose Mars is at 23Li17 and Ketu is at 
5Cn54. Suppose we have a tie after (4). Advancement  of Mars in Li is 23 °17'. 
Advancement of Ketu from the end of Cn is 30 ° – 5 °54' = 24 °6'. Because Ketu is 
more advanced, Ketu is stronger than Mars and becomes the primary lord of Sc. 
 
Exercise 25:  Find the primary lord of Aq and Sc in Chart 12 for  the purpose of 
arudha padas. 
 
15.5.2  Stronger Rasi 
 
When computing rasi dasas, we sometimes need to fin d the strongest rasi out of 2 or 
3 or 4 rasis. In this book, we will mainly use Nara yana dasa and we will only need to 
compare the strengths of 2 rasis. To conclude that a rasi is stronger than another rasi 
for the purpose of rasi dasas, we use the following  rules. We use the same rules for 
finding the stronger rasi owned by a planet, when computing its graha arudha. We go 
from one rule to the next only if there is no winne r after the rule. When we have a 
winner, we stop and do not go to the next rule. 
 
(1)  If one rasi contains more planets than the other ra si, then it is stronger. Suppose 
we are comparing the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppos e Ar contains Saturn and 
Jupiter and Li contains Venus. Then Ar is stronger, as it contains more planets. 
(2)  We find how many of the following planets occupy/as pect a rasi: (1) Jupiter, (2) 
Mercury, and, (3) the rasi’s lord. A rasi occupied/ aspected by more of these 3 
planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here.  Suppose we are compring the 
strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose Jupiter is in Ar, M ercury and Venus are in Ta 
and Mars is in Vi. Then Ar is occupied by Jupiter a nd not by the other two 
(Mercury and lord Mars). Its count is 1. Li is aspe cted by two (Mercury and lord 
                                                
 
53  We will learn the computation of dasa years in Narayana dasa later.

 204 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Venus) and only Jupiter doesn’t aspect it (we are u sing rasi aspects). So Li’s 
count of 2 beats Ar’s count of 1 and Li is stronger than Ar. 
(3)  If one rasi contains an exalted planet and the othe r does not, then the former rasi 
is stronger. Suppose we are compring the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose Saturn 
and Mercury are in Li and Jupiter and Venus are in Ar. Suppose we have a tie 
between Ar and Li after rule (2). Then we note that  Saturn is exalted in Li and 
declare Li as the stronger rasi. 
(4)  A rasi whose lord is in a rasi with a different odd ity (odd/even) is stronger than a 
rasi whose lord is in a rasi with the same oddity. Suppose we are compring the 
strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose we have a tie after  rule (3). Suppose Venus is in 
Cn, an even rasi and Mars is in Le, an odd rasi. Bo th Ar and Li are odd rasis. 
Because the lord of Li is in an even rasi ( i.e.  a rasi with a different oddity) and 
the lord of Ar is in an odd rasi ( i.e.  a rasi with the same  oddity), Li is stronger.  
NOTE : If we have a tie upto rule (3) when finding the s tronger rasi owned by a 
planet for computing its graha arudha, this rule wi ll surely resolve the tie, 
because the two rasis owned by each planet have a d ifferent oddity. So one of 
them will have the lord in a rasi with a different oddity. 
(5)  If we have a tie after rule (4), we use the natural  strength of rasis. Dual rasis are 
stronger than fixed rasis and fixed rasis are stron ger than movable rasis. This rule 
is not useful in Narayana dasa, because we always c ompare a rasi and the 7 th  
from it. If a rasi is dual/fixed/movable, the 7 th  from it is also of the same type. 
However, this rule is useful in some other dasas. 
(6)  If we have a tie after rule (5), we look at the lon gitudes of the lords of the two 
rasis. We measure the advancement of each planet fr om the beginning of the rasi 
occupied by it (from the end of the rasi in the cas e of Rahu and Ketu) and 
compare them. The rasi owned by the planet with the  higher advancement is 
stronger. Suppose we are comparing the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose we have 
a tie after rule (5). Suppose Mars is at 23Ge17 and  Venus is at 19Le51. 
Advancement of Mars (lord of Ar) in his rasi is 23 °17'. Advancement of Venus 
(lord of Li) in his rasi is 19 °51'. Because Mars is more advanced, his Ar is 
stronger than Li. 
N
OTE : In the case of Aq and Sc, we use the stronger lor d. For Rahu and Ketu, 
advancement in rasi is measured from the end of the  rasi. If Rahu is at 9Sc34, his 
advancement in Sc is 30 ° – 9 °34' = 20 °26'.

 Part 1: Chart Analysis 205 
 
 
 
Exercise 26: Consider Chart 12. Identify the stronger rasi from each pair below: 
(1) Ar & Li, (2) Ta & Sc, (3) Ge & Sg, (4) Cn & Cp, (5) Le & Aq, and, (6) Vi & Pi. 
 
Warning : The above rules are too general. One should under stand the meaning of 
each rule and adapt based on the situation. For exa mple, aspect of Mercury, Jupiter 
and lord is important for Narayana dasa and other p halita dasas. In ayur dasas that 
show longevity, aspect of luminaries (Sun and Moon)  are important. Aspect of all 
other planets is equally important. There is no sig nificance for the aspect of lord. In 
dasas based on AK ( e.g.  Atmakaraka kendradi graha/rasi dasas), the sign co ntaining 
AK is stronger than any other rasi. After we check for the aspects of Mercury, Jupiter 
and rasi lord, we should look at the placement of r asi lord from AK. A rasi who lord 
is in a quadrant from AK is stronger than a rasi wh ose lord is in a panaphara from 
AK. These rules, however, are not applicable to all dasas. 
 
15.6  Anwers to Exercises 
 
Exercise 24: 
 
Sun is in “Sabhaa” avastha and his strength is “Che shta”. His results are “helps 
others, possesses wealth, gems and lands, virtuous,  very strong, affectionate and 
kind”. They are given in full. 
 
Mars is in “Nidraa” avastha and his strength is “Dr ishti”. His results are “angry, 
unintelligent, poor, wicked, fallen from the virtuo us path, sick” and they are given to 
a medium degree. 
 
Jupiter is in “Aagama” avastha and his strength is “Cheshta”. His results are “many 
conveyances, comforts, honors, servants, happiness from progeny, knowledge, 
friends, learning and noble path” and they are given in full. 
 
Exercise 25: 
 
Rahu is alone and Saturn is alone. We have a tie af ter rule (1). Saturn is aspected by 
Mercury and not aspected/conjoined by Jupiter and h is dispositor (Jupiter again). 
Rahu is aspected by Venus (his dispositor) and not aspected by Mercury and Jupiter. 
Both have a count of one and we have a tie after ru le (2). Neither Saturn nor Rahu is 

--- Page 218 ---
  
 
 206 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
exalted after rule (3). Now we use rule (4). Saturn  is in a dual rasi and Rahu is in a 
movable rasi. So Saturn is stronger and he becomes the primary lord of Aq. 
 
Mars is in Sc and Ketu is elsewhere (in Ar). So we don’t even have to go through the 
rules to find the stronger planet. We use the “basi c rule” and declare Ketu as the 
primary lord of Sc. 
 
Exercise 26: 
 
(1)  Ar and Li have one planet each. There is a tie in r ule (1). Ar is aspected by 
Jupiter & lord Mars. Li is aspected only by lord Ve nus. Ar is stronger than Li, 
from rule (2). 
(2)  Sc has 2 planets and Ta has 1. Sc is stronger than Ta, from rule (1). 
(3)  Sg has 2 planets and Ge is empty. Sg is stronger than Ta, from rule (1). 
(4)  Cp has 1 planet and Cn is empty. Cp is stronger than Cn, from rule (1). 
(5)  Le and Aq are empty. There is a tie after rule (1).  Le is not aspected by any of 
Jupiter, Mercury and lord Sun. Aq is aspected by co -lord Rahu (though Saturn is 
the primary/stronger lord, Rahu’s aspect also count s). Aq is stronger than Le, 
from rule (2). 
(6)  Pi has 1 planet and Vi is empty. Pi is stronger than Vi, from rule (1).

Part 2:  Dasa Analysis 
 
 
One unique feature of Vedic astrology is its concep t of “dasa” 
systems. Dasa means “a period”. One’s lifetime is d ivided into 
several periods, sub-periods, sub-sub-periods and s o on. These 
are ruled by different planets or rasis. Planets an d rasis give 
their results in their respective periods and sub-p eriods. Each 
dasa system has a specific use. The nature of resul ts given by 
planets and rasis in their respective periods and s ub-periods 
depends on the dasa system being used. 
 
There are many classifications of dasa systems: 
 
(1)  Nakshatra dasas and Rasi dasas: Nakshatra dasas are 
based on Moon’s nakshatra (constellation). Rasi das as are 
based on rasis occupied by planets and dasas are ow ned 
by rasis in rasi dasas. 
 
(2)  Phalita dasas and Ayur dasas:  Phalita means results and 
ayur means longevity. Phalita dasas are used for ge neral 
results and ayur dasas are used for predicting death. 

--- Page 220 ---
  
 
 208 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
 
 
Hundreds of dasa systems were enumerated by the see rs of 
Vedic astrologey. Specific uses of these dasa syste ms weren’t 
clearly mentioned in classics. These are hidden in remote 
corners of India as family secrets. 
 
In this part, the use of the following dasa systems  is explained 
in detail: 
 
• Vimsottari dasa:  Nakshatra dasa (phalita/ayur) 
• Ashtottari dasa:  Nakshatra dasa (ayur/phalita) 
• Narayana dasa:  Rasi dasa (phalita - general) 
• Lagna Kendradi  
Rasi dasa: Rasi dasa (phalita – material fortune) 
• Sudasa:  Rasi dasa (phalita – material fortune) 
• Drigdasa:  Rasi dasa (phalita – spirituality) 
• Niryaana 
Shoola dasa:  Rasi dasa (ayur) 
• Shoola dasa:  Rasi dasa (ayur) 
• Kalachakra dasa:  Nakshatra dasa (phalita) 
 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa  is one of the most important dasas 
mentioned by Parasara. However, for reasons that wi ll become 
clear later, we will learn it in the part “Tajaka Analysis”.

16.  Vimsottari Dasa 
 
16.1  Introduction 
 
Vimsottari dasa is the most popular dasa system amo ng Vedic astrologers of today. 
Sage Parasara mentions in “Brihat Parasara Hora Sas tram” that this dasa system is 
the most suitable dasa system in Kali yuga. 
 
Vimsottari means 120. Vimsottari dasa is a dasa sys tem where the total duration of 
the dasa cycle is 120 years. Dasas of different pla nets are for different number of 
years, but the sum of all dasas is 120 years. 
 
In Kali yuga, paramaayush (maximum longevity) of human beings is supposed to be 
120 years. Consequently, Vimsottari dasa is the most suitable dasa in Kali yuga. 
 
Dasas are reckoned here based on the constellation occupied by Moon. There are 
other variations that are more applicable in some c ases. Many contemporary Vedic 
astrologers ignore these variations and always reck on dasas from the lord of the 
constellation occupied by Moon. However, this may n ot result in the best predictions 
always. In this book, we will look at some of the variations. 
 
One’s life is divided into dasas – periods – ruled by the nine planets. A dasa is also 
called a “mahadasa” (mahadasa = master period). Eac h mahadasa is again divided 
into 9 sub-periods ruled by 9 planets. These sub-pe riods in mahadasas are called 
“antardasas”. We can divide further. Sub-periods in  antardasas are called 
“pratyantardasas”. Sub-periods in pratyantardasas a re called “sookshma-antardasas” 
or simply sookshma dasas. Sub-periods in sookshma d asas are called “prana-
antardasas” or simply prana dasas. Sub-periods in p rana dasas are called “deha-
antardasas”. In this book, we will denote mahadasa with MD, antardasa with AD, 
pratyantardasa with PD, sookshma dasa with SD, pran a-antardasa with PAD and 
deha-antardasa with DAD.

16.2  Dasa Computation 
 
The lengths of the dasas (periods) of various planets are given in Table 38. The order 
of dasas is also as indicated in that table. For ex ample, let us say that the first dasa is 
Sun’s. It will be of 6 years. Then 10 years of Moon  dasa will follow. Then 7 years of 
Mars dasa will follow. And so on. At the end of the  table, we come back to the first 
entry. For example, let us say that the first dasa is of Jupiter. Then the order of dasas 
will be Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun (go back), Moon, Mars and Rahu. 
 
Table 38: Vimsottari Dasa Lengths 
Planet Dasa length (in years) 
Sun 6 
Moon 10 
Mars 7 
Rahu 18 
Jupiter 16 
Saturn 19 
Mercury 17 
Ketu 7 
Venus 20 
Total 120 
 
In this manner, we can find the order of dasas and dasa lengths, given the first dasa. 
 
For computing Vimsottari dasa, use the following steps: 
 
(1)  Find the constellation occupied by Moon. 
 
(2)  Find the advancement of Moon in the constellation. 
 
(3)  Find the part of the constellation that is yet to be traversed by Moon, as a fraction 
of the length of the constellation. [N
OTE : Length of each constellation is 13 °20'.] 
 
(4)  First dasa will belong to the lord of the constellation. 
 
(5)  Find the sequence of dasas and dasa lengths from Table 38. 

--- Page 223 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 211 
 
 
 
 
(6)  Multiply the length of the first dasa by the fracti on found in step (3). Only this 
amount in the first dasa is left at birth. The rest was over before birth. 
 
Controversy: Dasa length of each planet was given in years in Ta ble 38. For 
example, Sun dasa is for 6 years. However, what is the meaning of “a year” here? Do 
we mean the normal solar year, i.e.  365.2425 days? Or, do we mean a savana year of 
360 days that is used when finding the running year  for calculating varsha bala (year 
strength) in shadbalas? Or, do we mean a period in which Moon traverses through 
360 constellations? Or, do we mean a period of 360 tithis (luni-solar days)? Most 
scholars, including this author’s guru Pt. Sanjay R ath, use solar years. However, this 
author prefers savana years based on the teachings of his father. Savana years will be 
used with nakshatra dasas in all the calculations g iven in this book. This is not meant 
to be a recommendation. 
 
Example 50: Let us say someone was born at 5:50 am on 2000 Apri l 28 (time zone: 
4 hours west of GMT). Moon is at 2 °23' in Aq at the time of birth. 
(1)  This is in the 3 
rd  pada (quarter) of Dhanishtha constellation. Dhanis htha 
constellation starts at 23 °20' in Cp and ends at 6 °40' in Aq. 
(2)  Moon’s advancement in Dhanishtha = 2Aq23 – 23Cp20 = 32 °23' – 23 °20' = 9 °3'. 
(3)  The total length of the constellation is 13 °20'. The length yet to be traversed in 
this constellation as a fraction of the total const ellation length = (13 °20' – 
9°3')/13 °20' = 4 °17'/13 °20' = (4x60+17)/(13x60+20) = 257/800 = 0.32125. Thi s 
is the fraction of the constellation yet to be traversed by Moon. 
(4)  First dasa belongs to the lord of Dhanishtha. It is Mars. 
(5)  Let us start from Mars. From Table 38, dasa sequenc e is: Mars (7 years), Rahu 
(18 years), Jupiter (16 years), Saturn (19 years), Mercury (17 years), Ketu (7 
years), Venus (20 years), Sun (6 years), Moon (10 years). 
(6)  First dasa needs a correction. Out of 7 years of Mars dasa, the amount left at birth 
= 7 x 0.32125 = 2.24875 years = 2 years 2 months 29  days 33 ghatis. [N OTE : 
Ghati = 1/60 th  of a day, i.e.  24 minutes.] 
 
The native was born at 5:50 am on 2000 April 28. We  can get the end date of Mars 
dasa by adding 2 years 2 months 29 days 33 ghatis t o it. We get about 7 pm on 2002 
July 15. Mars dasa will be over then and Rahu dasa will start. We get Rahu dasa’s 
end date by adding 18 years to this date. Similarly , we can find the start and end 
dates of all dasas. 

--- Page 224 ---
  
 
 212 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
16.3  Antardasa Computation 
 
Each mahadasa is divided into 9 antardasas. Take th e planet ruling the mahadasa. 
First antardasa will belong to the same planet and antardasas go in the same 
sequence as dasas. The complete length of the mahad asa is ditributed among 
antardasas in the ratio of mahadasa years of planets. 
 
For example, let us take Venus dasa of the native o f Example 50. Venus dasa runs 
for 20 years. Antardasas in Venus dasa start from V enus and go in the order given in 
Table 38. So antardasa order in Venus dasa is — Ven us, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Ketu. Length of Venus antardasa is 20/120 of the total 
dasa length, i.e.  20x20/120 years = 3 years and 4 months. Length of Sun antardasa is 
6/120 of the total dasa length, i.e.  20x6/120 years = 1 year. Length of Moon 
antardasa is 10/120 of the total dasa length, i.e.  20x10/120 years = 1 year and 8 
months. Length of Mars antardasa is 7/120 of the to tal dasa length, i.e.  20x7/120 
years = 1 year and 2 months. In this manner, we pro portionally divide the period of a 
mahadasa into 9 antardasas. 
 
We use the same procedure to divide each antardasa into 9 pratyantardasas, each 
pratyantardasa into 9 sookshma dasas and so on. 
 
In the case of the first dasa, we don’t divide the remainder at birth (2.24875 years of 
Mars dasa remainder, for example, in Example 50) in to 9 antardasas. Instead, we 
divide the complete duration of the first dasa (7 y ears of Mars dasa, for example, in 
Example 50) into 9 antardasas. So a few antardasas may be over before birth and 
only a few antardasas may be left at birth. 
 
From now on, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with the computations. If 
the reader does not have any software and needs to compute dasas by hand, he or she 
should practice with many charts. 
 
16.4  Vimsottari Dasa Variations 
 
16.4.1  Computation of Variations 

--- Page 225 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 213 
 
 
 
 
We always compute the fraction left at birth in the  first dasa based on the fraction of 
the constellation occupied by Moon, that is yet to be traversed by Moon. However, 
we need not always take the lord of Moon’s constellation as the planet ruling the first 
dasa. We can take the lord of the 4 
th , 5 th  or 8 th  constellation from Moon’s 
constellation to start the first dasa. These 3 star s are called kshema, utpanna and 
adhana stars. 
 
Example 51: Let us consider the data of Example 50 and calcula te Vimsottari dasa 
from 4 
th , 5 th  and 8 th  stars. 
 
The 4 
th  star from Moon’s star is Uttarabhadrapada owned by  Saturn. Using the 4 th  
star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequ ence as — Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, 
Venus etc . Dasa lengths are the same as before, but the part  of Saturn dasa left at 
birth is 19 x 0.32125 = 6.10375 years. Then Mercury  dasa is for 17 years, Ketu dasa 
is for 7 years and so on. 
 
In the same example, the 5 
th  star from Moon’s star is Revathi owned by Mercury.  
Using the 5 th  star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa seq uence as — Mercury, 
Ketu, Venus, Sun etc . Mercury dasa left at birth is 17 x 0.32125 = 5.46 125 years. 
Then Ketu dasa is for 7 years, Venus dasa is for 20 years and so on. 
 
In the same example, the 8 
th  star from Moon’s star is Krittika owned by Sun. Us ing 
the 8 th  star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence as — Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Rahu etc . Sun dasa left at birth is 6 x 0.32125 = 1.9275 ye ars. Then Moon dasa is for 
10 years, Mars dasa is for 7 years and so on. 
 
16.4.2  Dasa from Lagna 
 
Some authorities have also recommended Vimsottari d asa from the longitude of 
lagna instead of Moon. In practice, this will give better results only when lagna is 
considerably more powerful than Moon. 
 
16.5  Using Vimsottari Dasa 
16.5.1  General Principles 

--- Page 226 ---
  
 
 214 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Vimsottari dasa is a very general phalita dasa that  can also be used as an ayur dasa. 
All kinds of general results can be seen from it. A  planet gives the results promised 
by its positions in various divisional charts. Here are just a few examples: 
 
(1)  Period of the 5 
th  lord in D-7 can give a child. 
(2)  Period of the 8 th  lord in rasi chart can give some troubles and frustration. 
(3)  Period of a planet exalted in GL in D-10 can give power and authority in career. 
(4)  Period of an exalted planet in the 12 th  from AK in D-9 can give serious thoughts 
related to spiritual liberation. 
(5)  Period of the 7 th  lord in D-9 can give marriage. 
(6)  Period of a planet with Rahu in the 9 th  in D-4 can give foreign residence. 
(7)  Period of an exalted planet aspecting HL from the 1 1 th  from AL in rasi chart can 
give a lot of wealth. 
(8)  Period of a planet joined by Moon and Saturn in the  8 th  house in D-30 may give 
serious psychological problems and suicidal tendencies. 
(9)  Period of a well-disposed planet aspecting A3 in D- 10 may make one write some 
books. 
 
These are just a few examples. One should look at v arious divisional charts and 
figure out the results indicated by different plane ts. Each planet gives the results 
indicated by it in its dasas and antardasas. When a nalyzing antardasas, we can take 
the dasa lord as a temporary lagna and analyze the charts. 
 
16.5.2  Using Dasa Variations 
 
If the sign containing the 5 
th  star from Moon is stronger than the sign containin g 
Moon, Vimsottari dasa started from utpanna star may  be preferred for general 
results. If the 5 th  star spans across 2 signs, take the sign containin g the same quarter 
as occupied by Moon in birthstar. If Moon is in Mak ha 3 rd  pada (quarter), for 
example, 5 th  star is Chitra and it starts in Virgo and ends in Libra. So we should take 
the 3 rd  quarter of Chitra and we then get Libra. So Leo’s strength should be 
compared to Libra’s. 
 
How do we know which sign is stronger? There are no  clear guidelines in the 
literature to compare the strengths. A sign aspecte d by Jupiter and occupied by more 
planets may be taken to be stronger. We can also use known events to see which dasa 
is working better. 

--- Page 227 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 215 
 
 
 
 
Vimsottari dasa started from the 4 
th  and 8 th  stars is used mainly for the purposes of 
longevity determination. Look at the signs containi ng Moon and these 2 stars and 
find the strongest sign. Here a sign aspected by ma rakas and malefics becomes 
stronger. Start Vimsottari dasa from the star in th e strongest of these 3 signs and use 
it in longevity analysis. If Moon is in Makha 3 rd  pada in Leo, 4 th  and 8 th  stars are 
Hasta (Virgo) and Anuradha (Scorpio). We should com pare the strengths of Leo, 
Virgo and Scorpio. 
 
16.5.3  Rath’s “Tripod of Life” Principle 
 
Sun, Moon and lagna form the “tripod of life”. Para sara clearly said that we should 
analyze all charts with respect to the positions of  Sun, Moon and lagna. He advised 
drawing Sudarsana chakra with the innermost chakra representing the houses with 
respect to lagna (body), next chakra representing t he houses with respect to Moon 
(mind) and the outermost chakra representing the houses with respect to Sun (soul). 
 
The results experienced due to soul (Sun) last long  and change slowly. The results 
experienced due to mind (Moon) last shorter and cha nge fast. The results 
experienced due to body (lagna) change even faster. 
 
Sun is an important reference point in rasi and div isional charts when judging the 
results of a mahadasa. Moon is an important referen ce point when judging the results 
of an antardasa. Lagna is an important reference po int when judging the results of a 
pratyantardasa. 
 
If a planet takes part in a Ravi yoga (solar combin ation), it gives the results of the 
yoga in its mahadasa. If a planet takes part in a C handra Yoga (lunar combination), it 
gives the results of the yoga in its antardasas. If  a planet takes part in other yogas 
(e.g. a Raja Yoga), it gives the results of the yoga primarily in its pratyantardasas. 
 
In addition, dasa lord can be taken as a reference point when interpreting antardasas. 
 
16.6  Practical Examples 
16.6.1  As A Phalita Dasa 
 

--- Page 228 ---
  
 
 216 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 52: Consider the dasamsa chart of Pandit Sanjay Rath, a  Vedic astrology 
author and founder of Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre (s ee Chart 17). Dasamsa shows 
one’s achievements in society. 
Chart 17 
 
 
Just a few days of Rahu dasa were left at birth. Me rcury dasa has been running since 
1998. During Mercury dasa, he published a brilliant  book “Crux of Vedic Astrology 
– Timing of Events” and he is writing more books. W hy did Mercury give book 
writing? 
 
Dasamsa shows achievements in society and A3 (arudh a pada of 3 
rd  house) shows 
the books authored by one. A3 is in Vi here. It has  argalas from the 11 th  from it by 
Venus and Jupiter and that shows saattwik and brill iant traditional knowledge as the 
catalyst bringing gains in his book-writing. Mercur y is the significator of writing and 
communication and he has argala on A3 from the 4 th  from it. This shows that good 
communication skills and scholarship (Mercury) are the basic driving factor in his 
book-writing. 
 

--- Page 229 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 217 
 
 
 
In addition to containing A3, Virgo is the 3 
rd  from GL. GL stands for power, 
authority and fame. The 3 rd  house from GL stands for fame as a communicator. 
Mercury owns and aspects it. In rasi chart, Mercury  gives Vesi yoga being in the 2 nd  
from Sun. So his dasa should bring the results of Vesi yoga. 
Chart 18 
 
 
For all these reasons, Mercury dasa can bring him b ook-writing activities and the 
fame that goes with it. He will author many more excellent books. 
 
Example 53:  Let us consider the D-7 chart of a lady who had he r first child in 
November 1994 and second child in December 1996 (see Chart 18). 
 
Moon is in Sun’s constellation. First dasa belongs to Sun. About 1 year and 3 months 
of Sun dasa was over before birth and the remainder  of Sun dasa at birth was about 4 
years and 9 months. Rahu dasa started at the end of  1993. This dasa gave her 
children. Let us explain why Rahu gave children. 
 

--- Page 230 ---

D-7 chart shows progeny. The 5 th  house shows children and it is in Aq here. It is 
owned by Saturn and Rahu. If one of the owners occu pies the sign, the other owner 
acts as the main owner, according to Parasara. Satu rn is in Aq. So Rahu acts as the 
5th  lord in this chart. He is in the 11 th  house of gains, with lagna lord Venus. His 
conjunction with Venus – conjunction of 1 st  and 5 th  lords – consists of a raja yoga in 
the house of gains. For these reasons, Rahu can giv e the happiness of getting a child. 
Antardasas at the time of childbirth belonged to Ra hu and Jupiter. Jupiter is the 
naisargika and chara puttra karaka and he is in the 5 th  house here. 
 
Rahu is the primary 5 
th  lord here. But, after all, Saturn also owns 5 th  and moreover he 
occupies 5 th  with Jupiter. He is the strongest planet in 5 th . Hence pratyantardasa at 
the time of both the childbirths belonged to Saturn . Pratyantardasa running at the 
time of an event usually belongs to the most import ant planet influencing the house 
of interest in the divisional chart of interest. 
 
Example 54: Let us consider the rasi chart of Sri Navin Patnai k (see Chart 19). He 
was elected as the Chief Minister of India’s Orissa state in early 2000. 
 
First dasa is of Mars and Mercury dasa started in J uly 1999. Mercury antardasa in 
Mercury mahadasa was running when he became Orissa’s CM. 
 
Mercury is in Libra. Rajya saham and GL are also in  Libra. So Mercury has the 
potential to bring kingdom. 
 
From AL, Mercury is in the 6 
th  house. Upachayas from AL bring gains in status and  
a planet in the 6 th  from AL can bring an improvement in status. 
 
Let us apply Rath’s “tripod of life” principle. Sun  is in Vi. We should judge 
mahadasa from Sun. Where is Mercury w.r.t. Sun? Mer cury is Sun’s dispositor and 
he is in the 2 
nd  from Sun. This results in a powerful Vesi yoga.

Chart 19 
 
 
Even taking Moon as the reference, Mercury is 1 
st  lord and he is in a trine. So he is 
favorably placed from Moon also. For this reason, M ercury’s antardasa is a good 
antardasa and there was success in the very first AD of Mercury MD. 
 
Of course, Mercury is a functional benefic in dasam sa, aspects GL and occupies 
rajya pada (A10) in a quadrant from lagna. These fa ctors also contributed to success 
in Mercury dasa. 
 
Example 55: Let us consider the rasi chart of an engineer who came from India to 
USA (see Chart 20). He studied at a reputed institution in India and had a good job at 
a big company in USA. He had a wife and two children.

He had a cruel shock when his wife filed a lawsuit against him in a US court at the 
end of 1995, accusing him of many wrong things that  he hadn’t done. She had his 
bank accounts frozen and had him evicted from his h ouse. He was then running 
Jupiter-Moon antardasa ( i.e.  Jupiter dasa, Moon antardasa) as per Vimsottari da sa. 
This author predicted to him that things would just  be fine and he would win the suit 
in Mars antardasa. However, he could not go through  with it, surrendered everything 
to his wife, left his excellent job, left his house  and kids to his wife and mother-in-
law and went back to India in mid-1996. He returned  to USA in 1998 to start fresh 
and started searching for a job. This author’s pred iction went wrong because he 
blindly used Vimsottari dasa started from Moon’s star. 
 
Why did Jupiter-Moon antardasa bring such a catastr ophe? Why was his life turned 
upside down? Jupiter is an exalted functional benef ic in a trine. Moon is an exalted 
functional benefic in a quadrant. Of course, we can  give vague reasons to justify 
almost anything, but that’s not the right approach.  If we use the right variation of the 
dasa, we don’t have to bend backwards or beat around the bush to explain events. 
 

--- Page 233 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 221 
 
 
 
Let us consider utpanna star. Moon is in Rohini. Th e 5 
th  star Pushyami is in Cancer 
and exalted Jupiter occupies it. Occupied by an exa lted planet and owned by another 
exalted planet, Cancer is very strong. It is a toug h call in this case, but dasas started 
from Pushyami explain the events better than dasas started from Rohini. 
 
First dasa belongs to Saturn. Venus dasa of 20 year s runs from February 1987 to 
October 2006. Venus is lagna lord and he gives Vesi  yoga being in the 2 
nd  from Sun. 
So his dasa is good. However, being the 8 th  lord from AL, he can also give a fall in 
status. 
 
Rahu’s antardasa runs during 1994-1997. As per Rath ’s “tripod of life” principle, we 
should give importance to Rahu’s position from Moon . Rahu is in the 8 
th  house from 
Moon and his antardasa is unfavorable. It can bring  unexpected troubles and 
frustration. Debilitated Rahu’s rasi aspect on AL c an also cast a shadow on one’s 
image and affect one’s status. 
 
Ketu’s pratyantardasa ran during December 1995-Febr uary 1996 when a lot of this 
drama unfolded and he was evicted from house with h is accounts frozen. That shook 
him up. We should give importance to lagna when jud ging pratyantardasas. Ketu is 
lagna lord in the 8 
th  house. Again it is a bad period. 
 
Sun’s pratyantardasa was running when he went back to India, leaving everything he 
had behind – including his job at a big company. Su n is the 10 
th  lord and he is 
debilitated in the 12 th  house, afflicted by Saturn and 8 th  lord. Moreover Sun is in the 
8th  house from AL and that adds to the indications of a fall in status. So Sun’s 
pratyantardasa can bring losses and fall in status.  During this pratyantardasa, he gave 
up everything he had and went back to India. 
 
Jupiter is the 8 
th  and 11 th  lord from Moon. He is in the 3 rd  from Moon. Jupiter in 3 rd  
gives a positive spirit. Jupiter antardasa can inje ct some energy into his nearly 
destroyed life. He came back to US in Jupiter antar dasa. Saturn is an exalted 
yogakaraka from Moon and his antardasa should bring gains again. 
 
16.6.2  As An Ayur Dasa 
 
We have so far seen examples of Vimsottari dasa use d as a phalita dasa. We will 
now see its use as an ayur dasa.

Example 56: We will consider John F. Kennedy, Jr’s rasi chart (see Chart 21). He 
passed away on the night of July 16, 1999. 
 
Parasara mentioned that the 3 
rd  and 8 th  houses are the houses of life and the 2 nd  and 
7th  houses are the houses of death. He said that the 2 nd  house is particularly a maraka 
(killer) house. Lords and occupants of these houses can kill a native. 
Chart 21 
 
 
Here the 2 
nd  house is Virgo. Its lord Mercury is in mrityu bhag a in the 3 rd  house. He 
is a strong maraka. Saturn is the 7 th  lord. He is also Maheswara, being the 8 th  lord 
from AK Mars. He joins Jupiter, who is Rudra. Satur n is also a strong maraka. Mr. 
Kennedy was running Saturn-Mercury antardasa when he passed away. 
 
Example 57: Let us consider the rasi chart of a lady who commi tted suicide on April 
6, 1988 (see Chart 22). 
 
Jupiter is the 7 
th  lord here and he is exalted. He is a very strong m araka. Venus is 2 nd  
lord in 2 nd  and he can kill too. 

--- Page 235 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 223 
 
 
 
 
Moon is in the 1 
st  quarter of Bharani constellation. The 4 th  constellation is Mrigasira. 
Because the 1 st  quarter of Mrigasira is in Taurus, we should take Taurus as the sign 
of 4 th  star. The 8 th star is Aasresha in Cancer. Cancer contains 7 th  lord Jupiter, a 
maraka. However, it is not aspected by 2 nd  lord. Taurus, on the other hand, has the 
rasi aspect of both Jupiter and Venus. Aspect of ma rakas makes a sign stronger. So 
start dasas from the 4 th star. 
Chart 22 
 
 
First dasa belongs to Mars and Jupiter-Venus antard asa was running at death. Both 
the planets are marakas. 
 
Example 58: Let us consider the rasi chart of great astrologer  Dr. B.V. Raman (see 
Chart 23). He passed away on 20 
th  December 1998, leaving a void in the astrological 
community. 
 
As per Vimsottari dasa reckoned from Moon’s star, h e passed away in Venus-Sun 
antardasa. Venus is a maraka being in the 7 
th  house, but he is not a very strong 

--- Page 236 ---
  
 
 224 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
maraka. Though Sun owns 7 th , he is in 6 th , i.e.  in the 12 th  from 7 th  and the 11 th  from 
8th . The likelihood of Sun killing the native is small. 
 
Who are the strongest marakas in this chart? Certai nly, Mercury is the strongest 
maraka. He owns 8 
th  and occupies 7 th . Malefics in the 2 nd  house are strong marakas. 
So Rahu in the 2 nd  is also a maraka. Mars is also a maraka, being the 3 rd  lord in 7 th . 
 
Chart 23 
 
 
Let us consider the variations of Vimsottari dasa b ased on 4 
th  and 8 th  stars. The 4 th  
star is Pushyami in Cancer. The 8 th  star is Uttaraphalguni and its 1 st  quarter is in Leo. 
Because Leo is the strongest sign, we can start das as from Sun who owns 
Uttaraphalguni (8 th  star from Moon’s star). 
 
Starting Vimsottari dasa from the 8 
th  star, we can see that Mercury-Rahu antardasa 
was running in December 1998. Killership of both th e planets has already been 
addressed.

16.7  Conclusion 
 
In this chapter, Vimsottari dasa and its variations  are explained and their use is 
demonstrated. Use of Vimsottari dasa as a phalita d asa as well as an ayur dasa is 
demonstrated. As this is the most common constellat ion-based dasa system, readers 
should master its use through practical experience. 
 
Though many people limit themselves to Vimsottari d asa started from the birthstar, 
one is advised to use the variations mentioned in this chapter for the best results. 
 
If all the quadrants from the stronger of lagna and  Moon are occupied by planets, 
“Kendradi Graha Dasa” is more appropriate than Vims ottari dasa. Results from 
Vimsottari dasa may not be very good in such cases. 
 
In addition, it should be noted that the error in t he start/end dates of dasas have an 
error of approximately m.n/4 days, if there is an error of m minutes in birthtime and 
the complete duration of the first dasa is n years. 
 
For example, if the first dasa belongs to Venus, th en n = 20. So an error of 5 minutes 
in the birthtime results in an error of 5x20/4 = 25  days in dasas (this is approximate). 
Considering this, we cannot use low level sub-perio ds of Vimsottari dasa (like 
sookshma dasas) confidently, unless we rectify the birthtime. 
 
It is a good idea to allow a margin of error when w e examine the dates on which 
dasas start and end.

17.  Ashtottari Dasa 
 
17.1  Introduction 
 
Ashtottari dasa is perhaps the most popular dasa sy stem in India after Vimsottari 
dasa. Sage Parasara listed it as a conditional dasa applicable only in some charts. The 
conditions for its applicability are highly controversial.  
 
In this system, the sum of all dasas is 108 years. Ashtottari means “ashtottara sata”, 
i.e.  one hundred and eight. Because poornaayush (full l ife) of a man is 108 years, 
some scholars have suggested that ashtottari dasa i s best used as an ayur dasa, i.e.  a 
dasa that shows longevity. 
 
Some other scholars suggest that Ashtottari dasa ca n be used as a phalita dasa. 
Because only chara karakas, i.e.  Rahu and the seven planets, have dasas under the 
Ashtottari dasa scheme, it may also be suggested th at it shows events related to 
sustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha (ju st like chara karakas do). Some 
people, however, prefer to see all matters in Ashtottari dasa. 
 
17.2  Computation 
 
17.2.1  Dasas 
 
Order of dasas and the length of dasas is as shown in Table 39. Each planet covers an 
arc of either 53 °20' (4 nakshatras) or 40 °0' (3 nakshatras) in the zodiac, as shown in 
that table. 
 
We note natal Moon’s longitude and see which of the  eight arcs it belongs to. The 
planet ruling the arc will rule the first dasa. The  fraction of the arc that is yet to be 
traversed by natal Moon is calculated and the same fraction of the dasa length of the 
first dasa lord is left at birth. After that, dasas  will come in the order shown in the 
table and the length of a planet’s dasa is the full  dasa length given in the table. After 
Venus, we come back to Sun at the beginning of the table.

Example 59: Suppose Moon is at 24 ° in Leo. That is equivalent to 24 °0' + 120 °0'  = 
144 °0'. We see that 144 ° is between 120 °0' and 160 °0'. So it is in the 2 
nd  arc of Table 
39, which is ruled by Moon. The full dasa length is  15 years. Here we have to find 
the fraction of the arc that is yet to be traversed . The arc starts at 120 °0' and ends at 
160 °0'. So the part of the arc that is yet to be traver sed by Moon is (160 °0' – 144 °0') 

--- Page 240 ---
  
 
 228 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
= 16 °. As a fraction of the arc length (40 °), this is 16 °/40 ° = 0.4. The same fraction 
of the full dasa length of Moon is 15 x 0.4 = 6 years. The native will run Moon dasa 
of 6 years from his birth. Then 8 years of Mars das a will run. Then 17 years of 
Mercury dasa will run. Then 10 years of Saturn dasa will run. And so on. 
 
N
OTE : One has to be careful with the calculation if the  first dasa is Rahu dasa. The 
arc ruled by Rahu starts at 333 °20' and ends at 26 °40'. The ending longitude 26 °40' is 
equivalent to 386 °40' and we should use either 26 °40' or 386 °40' based on Moon’s 
longitude. For example, if Moon is at 10º in Aries,  then the part of the arc that is yet 
to be traversed is 26 °40' – 10 ° = 16 °40'. If Moon is at 20º in Pisces, i.e.  at 350º, then 
the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed is 386 °40' – 350 ° = 36 °40'. 
 
17.2.2  Antardasas 
 
The first antardasa belongs to the planet that come s in the table after  the dasa lord. 
Then antardasas go in the same order as dasas and t he last antardasa belongs to dasa 
lord. For example, antardasas in Jupiter dasa go as : Rahu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter. Antardasas in Moon dasa go as: Mars, Mercury, Saturn, 
Jupiter, Rahu, Venus, Sun and Moon. 
 
The length of a dasa is divided into eight antardas as in the ratio of the dasa lengths. 
For example, Sun dasa is of 6 years. Moon antardasa  in Sun dasa is of 6 
x 15/108 = 
0.8333 year = 10 months. Mars antardasa in Sun dasa  is of 6 x 8/108 = 0.4444 year = 
5 months 10 days. Mercury antardasa in Sun dasa is of 6 x 17/108 = 0.9444 years = 
11 months 10 days. And so on. 
 
17.2.3  Application 
 
There are three different views on the applicability of Ashtottari dasa: 
 
(1)  Ashtottari dasa is applicable in all charts. 
(2)  Ashtottari dasa is applicable if Rahu, who is not i n lagna, is in a quadrant or a 
trine from lagna lord. 
(3)  Ashtottari dasa is applicable for daytime births in  Krishna paksha (darker 
fortnight) and night time births in Sukla paksha (brighter fortnight). 
 

--- Page 241 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 229 
 
 
 
Some people use Ashtottari dasa as an ayur dasa and  see longevity in it. Some other 
people use Ashtottari dasa as a phalita dasa. Becau se only chara karakas, i.e.  Rahu 
and the seven planets, have dasas under the Ashtott ari dasa scheme, it may also be 
suggested that it shows events related to sustenanc e, achievements, raja yogas and 
moksha (just like chara karakas do). Some people, h owever, prefer to see all matters 
in Ashtottari dasa. 
 
17.3  Examples 
 
Example 60: We saw the chart of great astrologer Dr. B.V. Rama n in Example 58. 
We noted that his sad demise on 20 
th  December 1998 makes better sense with 
Vimsottari dasa started from the 8 th  nakshatra from Moon’s nakshatra than 
Vimsottari dasa started from Moon’s nakshatra. As per the former, he passed away in 
Mercury-Rahu antardasa. Mercury is the 8 th  lord in the 7 th  house of death and Rahu is 
a malefic in the 2 nd  house of death.  
 
One may compute Ashtottari dasa for the birthdata g iven in Chart 23 and find that 
Rahu-Mercury antardasa was running at the time of h is death. For reasons already 
explained, Rahu and Mercury are the strongest marak as in this chart. It is significant 
that the same planets gave death in both dasas. 
 
Example 61: Let us consider the assassination of Indira Gandhi . Her birthdata and 
assassination data are given in Example 110 (in a l ater chapter). Her rasi chart is 
given in Chart 61. 
 
One may calculate Ashtottari dasa for her and find that Moon dasa ran from 1980-
1995. Saturn antardasa was running at the time of her assassination. 
 
Saturn is the 7 
th  lord in lagna and Moon is in the 7 th  house. They are the only planets 
strongly associated with the 7 th  house of death. They can give death. 
 
Example 62: Let us consider Sri P.V. Narasimha Rao’s rasi char t given in Chart 6. 
He held important ministerial berths in Indian gove rnment during 1980-1989 and he 
was India’s Prime Minister during 1991-1996. 
 

--- Page 242 ---
  
 
 230 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
If one calculates his Ashtottari dasa, one will fin d that Mercury dasa ran during 
1981-1997. Mercury is lagna lord and he occupies an  own sign. He is in the the 7 th  
house from AL and GL and certainly promises power. The planet bringing a link 
between lagna and GL by way of aspect, ownership an d occupancy brings power. 
Mercury is lagna lord and he has a rasi aspect on b oth lagna and GL. He can give 
power. 
 
Moreover, Sri Rao’s chart has a powerful Vipareeta Raja yoga (VRY) between 3 
rd  
and 8 th  lord Mars and 12 th  lord Sun, who are within a 17' from each other. If  the 
planets involved in VRY have a conjunction or rasi aspect with lagna lord, then VRY 
can give permanent results and the power is transfe rred to lagna lord. Here Mercury 
is the dispositor of Mars and Sun and joins them in  his own rasi. He has 7 rekhas in 
BAV and his rasi Gemini has 34 rekhas in SAV. Mercu ry is in Uttamamsa. For all 
these reasons, Mercury is a great yoga karaka. So his dasa (1981-1997) was excellent 
from Sri Rao. 
 
17.4  Conclusion 
 
Ashtottari dasa is a popular dasa, but its applicab ility as well as application are 
controversial. Readers should keep this in mind and  keep their minds open to 
alternative views. What is taught in this book is n ot the final truth. Of course, this 
applies to everything taught in this book, but it i s especially applicable to this 
chapter.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 231 
 
 
 
18.  Narayana Dasa 
 
18.1  Introduction 
 
Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It shows general 
results. Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divisional charts and we 
can use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to pred ict matters related to that 
divisional chart. 
 
Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one’s life. As one dasa ends 
and another starts, one rasi stops being the progre ssed lagna and another rasi 
becomes one’s progressed lagna. Using the progresse d lagna as the reference, we 
find out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each 
person, with each chart applicable in one dasa. 
 
This is a very versatile dasa system and readers so uld pay attention to the details of 
calculation. 
 
18.2  Computation 
 
18.2.1  Dasa Progression 
 
Dasas start from lagna or the 7 
th  house, whichever is stronger. We use the rules of 
strength explained in the chapter “Strength of Plan ets and Rasis”. Let us denote the 
stronger of lagna and 7 th  house by the expression “dasa seed”. 
 
Movable signs are governed by Brahma. Fixed signs a re governed by Shiva. Dual 
signs are govenred by Vishnu. 
54  Brahma is associated with the regular movement of 
1st , 2 nd , 3 rd  etc . Vishnu is associated with the trinal movement, i.e.  1 st , 5 th , 9 th , then 
10 th , 2 nd , 6 th  and so on. We cover the trines from dasa seed firs t, go to another 
                                                 
54  Brahma is the God of creation. Vishnu is the God o f sustenance. Shiva is the God of destruction. 
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are together known as “Tri murthis” (the “Trinity of Gods”). 

--- Page 244 ---
  
 
 232 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
quadrant and cover its trines and so on. Shiva, on the other hand, is associated with 
the 6 th  movment. We take dasa seed, 6 th  from there, 6 th  from there and so on. 
 
The direction of reckoning these houses is based on  the 9 
th  house from dasa seed. If 
the 9 th  house from dasa seed is an odd-footed sign (Ar, Ta , Ge and Li, Sc, Sg), the 
direction is forward. If the 9 th  house from dasa seed is an even-footed sign (Cn, L e, 
Vi and Cp, Aq, Pi), the direction is backward. 
 
Example 63: Suppose someone has lagna in Ta. Suppose Sc is str onger than Ta. Let 
us find the dasa progression. 
 
Because the 7 
th  house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa 
seed is Sc. Because it is a fixed sign, we use “eve ry 6 th ” progression governed by 
Shiva. The 9 th  house from Sc is Cn. It is an even-footed sign. So  the overall direction 
is backward. So we should count houses in the backw ard direction. The 6 th  house 
from Sc, counted backwards, is Ge. The 6 th  therefrom is Cp. We count the 6 th house 
from every rasi in the backward direction and get the complete dasa sequence as: 
 
Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li, Ta, Sg, Cn, Aq, Vi and Ar 
 
This is the order of dasas for the native. 
 
Example 64: Suppose someone has lagna in Pi. Suppose Pi is str onger than Vi. Let 
us find the dasa progression. 
 
Because lagna is stronger than the 7 
th  house, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa 
seed is Pi. Because it is a dual sign, we use the t rinal progression governed by 
Vishnu. The 9 th  house from Pi is Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. So the overall direction 
is forward. So we should count houses in the forwar d direction. We count the 1 st , 5 th , 
9th  houses from dasa seed, then count the same houses from the 10 th  house, then from 
the 7 th  house and finally from the 4 th  house. Trines from Pi are Pi, Cn and Sc. Trines 
from the 10 th  (Sg) are Sg, Ar and Le. We get the complete dasa sequence as: 
 
Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le, Vi, Cp, Ta, Ge, Li and Aq. 
 
This is the order of dasas for the native.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 233 
 
 
 
Example 65: Suppose someone has lagna in Cn. Suppose Cp is str onger than Cn. 
Let us find the dasa progression. 
 
Because the 7 
th  house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa 
seed is Cp. Because it is a movable sign, we use th e regular (1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd ) progression 
governed by Brahma. The 9 th  house from Cp is Vi. It is an even-footed sign. So  the 
overall direction is backward. So we should count h ouses in the backward direction. 
We count the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd  etc  houses from dasa seed backwards. We get the comple te 
dasa sequence as: 
 
Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Pi and Aq. 
 
This is the order of dasas for the native. 
 
Saturn exception: 
 
If Saturn occupies dasa seed, dasa progression beco mes regular and zodiacal. If Sc is 
dasa seed and it contains Saturn, dasa progression becomes Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar 
etc . If Pi is dasa seed and it contains Saturn, dasa p rogression becomes Pi, Ar, Ta, 
Ge, Cn, Le etc . We basically make the direction “forward” and use  Brahma’s 
progression. 
 
Ketu exception: 
 
If Ketu occupies dasa seed, the basic direction of dasa progression becomes reversed. 
If it is normally forward, it becomes backward. If it is normally backward, it 
becomes forward. If Sc is dasa seed and it contains  Ketu, dasa progression becomes 
Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg etc  (comparing this with Example 63, readers may note that 
the 6 
th  house is counted in the forward direction instead of the backward direction). 
If Pi is dasa seed and it contains Ketu, dasa progr ession becomes Pi, Sc, Cn, Ge, Aq, 
Li etc  (comparing this with Example 64, readers may note that the 5 th , 9 th , 10 th  etc  
house etc are counted in the backward  direction instead of the forward direction.). 
 
Dasa progressions for various dasa seeds are given in Table 40. Three cases are 
covered for each dasa seed — ( a) the normal case, ( b) with Saturn exception, and, ( c) 
with Ketu exception.

We should choose the dasa progression based on dasa  seed. If neither Saturn nor 
Ketu occupies dasa seed, we should use the normal p rogression. If Saturn occupies 
dasa seed, we should apply the Saturn exception. If  Ketu occupies dasa seed, we 
should apply the Ketu exception. 
 
18.2.2  Dasa Length 
 
The length of a dasa is determined by the position of the lord of dasa rasi with 
respect to dasa rasi. Counting is forward if dasa r asi is odd-footed. Counting is 
backward if dasa rasi is even-footed. Count houses from dasa rasi to its lord. Subtract 
one from the count. That gives dasa length in years. 
 
Exceptions: 
 
(1)  If the count of houses from dasa rasi to its lord i s one, i.e.  dasa rasi contains its 
lord, then we get zero by subtracting one from one.  However, dasa length 
becomes 12 years then. 
(2)  If the lord of dasa rasi is exalted, add one year to dasa length. 
(3)  If the lord of dasa rasi is debilitated, subtract one year from dasa length. 
 
Special Notes: 
 
(1)  If dasa rasi is Aq or Sc, it has two lords. We shou ld take the stronger lord when 
computing Narayana dasa. 
(2)  After dasas of all the rasis are over, the second c ycle starts. In the second cycle, 
dasa lengths of various rasis are obtained by subtr acting the dasa length in the 
first cycle from 12 years. 
 
Example 66:  Let us take the rasi chart in Chart 23 and compute  Narayana dasa. 
Because the 7 
th  house (Le) is stronger than lagna (Aq), dasa seed is Le. Because it is 
a fixed sign, we use the “every 6 th ” progression governed by Shiva. Because the 9 th  
from Le (Ar) is odd-footed, we count in the forward  direction. Neither Saturn nor 

--- Page 248 ---
  
 
 236 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Ketu occupies Le and the exceptions don’t apply. Da sa sequence is — Le, Cp, Ge, 
Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg, Ta, Li, Pi. Let us now find the lengths of various dasas.  
 
Le is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Le to its lord Sun in the 
backward direction. Sun is in Cn, i.e.  the 2 
nd  house from Le in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 2–1=1 year. The native  was born in August 1912. This 
dasa runs from Aug 1912 to Aug 1913. 
 
Cp is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Cp to its lord Saturn in the 
backward direction. Saturn is in Ta, i.e.  the 9 
th  house from Cp in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 9–1=8 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1913 to Aug 1921. 
 
Ge is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from G e to its lord Mercury in the 
forward direction. Mercury is in Le, i.e.  the 3 
rd  house from Ge in the forward 
direction. So dasa length is 3–1=2 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1921 to Aug 1923. 
 
Sc is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from S c to its lord Mars in the forward 
direction. Mars is in Le, i.e. the 10 
th  house from Sc in the forward direction. So dasa 
length is 10–1=9 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1923 to Aug 1932. 
 
Ar is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from A r to its lord Mars in the forward 
direction. Mars is in Le, i.e.  the 5 
th  house from Ar in the forward direction. So dasa 
length is 5–1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1932 to Aug 1936. 
 
Vi is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Vi to its lord Mercury in the 
backward direction. Mercury is in Le, i.e.  the 2 
nd  house from Vi in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 2–1=1 year. This dasa runs from Aug 1936 to Aug 1937. 
 
Aq is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Aq to its lord Saturn in the 
backward direction. Saturn is in Ta, i.e.  the 10 
th  house from Aq in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 10–1=9 years. This das a runs from Aug 1937 to Aug 
1946. 
 
Cn is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Cn to its lord Moon in the 
backward direction. Moon is in Ta, i.e.  the 3 
rd  house from Cn in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 3–1=2 years. However, Moon is exalted and we add one 
year. We get 2+1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1946 to Aug 1949. 
 

--- Page 249 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 237 
 
 
 
Sg is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from S g to its lord Jupiter in the 
forward direction. Jupiter is in Sc, i.e.  the 12 
th  house from Sg in the forward 
direction. So dasa length is 12–1=11 years. This da sa runs from Aug 1949 to Aug 
1960. 
 
Ta is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from T a to its lord Venus in the 
forward direction. Venus is in Le, i.e.  the 4 
th  house from Ta in the forward direction. 
So dasa length is 4–1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1960 to Aug 1963. 
 
Li is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Li to its lord Venus in the forward 
direction. Venus is in Le, i.e.  the 11 
th  house from Li in the forward direction. So dasa 
length is 11–1=10 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1963 to Aug 1973. 
 
Pi is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Pi to its lord Jupiter in the 
backward direction. Jupiter is in Sc, i.e.  the 5 
th  house from Pi in the backward 
direction. So dasa length is 5–1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1973 to Aug 1977. 
 
Thus the first cycle of dasas ends in Aug 1977. The  second cycle starts then. Dasas 
will come in the same order as in the first cycle. Let us compute the second cycle. 
 
Because Le dasa is of 1 year in the 1 
st  cycle, it is 12–1=11 years in the 2 nd  cycle. This 
dasa runs from Aug 1977 to Aug 1988. 
 
Because Cp dasa is of 8 years in the 1 
st  cycle, it is 12–8=4 years in the 2 nd  cycle. This 
dasa runs from Aug 1988 to Aug 1992. 
 
Because Ge dasa is of 2 years in the 1 
st  cycle, it is 12–2=10 years in the 2 nd  cycle. 
This dasa runs from Aug 1992 to Aug 2002. 
 
Exercise 27: Calculate Narayana dasa for the rasi chart given i n Chart 21. ( Hints : 
Saturn is the stronger lord of Aq and Ketu is the s tronger lord of Sc. Aq is stronger 
than Le.) 
 
18.3  Antardasas 
 

--- Page 250 ---
  
 
 238 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. All the an tardasas have an equal length. If a 
dasa is of n years, then each antardasa in that dasa is for n months. 
 
Antardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of dasa rasi or the rasi containing 
the lord of the 7 
th  house from dasa rasi. Let us denote the stronger o f dasa rasi and 
the 7 th  from it with the expression “antardasa seed”. Anta rdasas start from the rasi 
containing the lord of antardasa seed and we take t he 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th  etc  houses from 
there. The direction of counting houses is forward or backward based on whether the 
rasi from which antardasas start is an odd rasi or even rasi. (N OTE : We are talking 
about odd and even signs here and not  about odd-footed and even-footed signs). 
 
Example 67: Suppose Cp dasa of 5 years is running. Lords of Cp  and Cn are Saturn 
and Moon respectively. Suppose Saturn is in Le and Moon is in Ta. Antardasas start 
from either Le or Ta. If Cp is stronger than Cn (or  Saturn is much stronger than 
Moon), then we start from Le. If Cn is stronger tha n Cp (or Moon is much stronger 
than Saturn), then we start from Ta. Let us say Cn is stronger than Cp and Saturn is 
not much stronger than Moon. Then antardasas start from Ta, which contains Moon. 
Because Ta is an even sign, counting is backward. S o antardasas go as — Ta, Ar, Pi, 
Aq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn and Ge. Each antardasa is of 5 months. 
 
Exceptions : If Saturn occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasas go in the forward 
direction. If Ketu occupies antardasa seed rasi, an tardasa direction is reversed (from 
forward to backward or from backward to forward). I n the above example, antardasa 
sequence becomes Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp , Aq and Pi, if Ketu occupies 
Cn. 
 
18.4  Interpretation 
 
Narayana dasa gives the progression of lagna in lif e. During the dasa of a rasi, that 
rasi acts as lagna. If dasas are started from the 7
th  house from lagna, then Narayana 
dasa gives the progression of the 7 th  house. So the 7 th  from dasa rasi gives the 
progressed lagna, i.e.  the rasi that acts as lagna during the dasa. 
 
Treat the dasa rasi or the 7 
th  from it – based on whether dasas start from lagna or the 
7th  house – as lagna and analyze the chart, to see for tune in a dasa. We will denote it 
with “dasa lagna”. We will denote the rasi containi ng the lord of dasa lagna with 
“paaka rasi”. 

--- Page 251 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 239 
 
 
 
 
Just as the strength of lagna lord is very importan t in a natal chart, strength of the 
lord of dasa lagna is the key to interpreting a das a. In addition, a lot of principles 
were mentioned by Parasara: 
 
Natural malefics in the 3 
rd  and 6 th  from dasa lagna give success in ventures. Natural 
benefics in those houses give failures. Natural ben efics in trines and 8 th  from dasa 
lagna give happiness and success. Natural malefics in those houses give failures, 
obstructions and unhappiness. Situation of a planet  – benefic or a malefic – in the 
11 th  house ensures gains. Rahu in the 8 th  and 12 th  houses from dasa lagna gives 
constant fear. If the lord of dasa lagna or the lor d of a trine or a quadrant from it is 
exalted or in own house, it gives excellent results . Debilitation, on the other hand, is 
bad. If the lord of a dusthana from dasa lagna is d ebilitated, it gives good results. If 
the 4 th  house from dasa lagna has malefics, there will be discomfort and lack of 
happiness. Benefics in the same house give happines s, well-being and pleasures. 
Benefics in the 2 nd  and 5 th  houses from dasa lagna give good name, fame and fa vors 
from authorities. Malefics in the same houses bring  bad results in the same areas. If 
the 7 th  house from dasa lagna and paaka rasi is afflicted by malefics, there may 
troubles in marriage. Raja yogas and dhana yogas wi th respect to dasa lagna bring 
success. If dasa lagna or paaka rasi is associated with an exalted planet or a planet in 
own house, there will be all-round success and accumulation of wealth in that dasa. 
 
In addition to interpreting dasas taking dasa lagna  as lagna, we can interpret dasas 
from the natal references also. For example, dasa o f raajya pada gives success in 
career. Dasa of upapada may bring marriage. Dasa of  the 2 
nd  house or the 7 th  house 
from upapada may bring troubles in marriage. Dasa o f GL may bring power. In 
particular, antardasas aspected by GL may bring pro motions. Antardasas aspecting 
upapada may bring marriage. Arudha padas aspected b y antardasa rasi are important 
in deciding the results in an antardasa. 
 
We also judge the results given in antardasas by lo oking at the house occupied by 
antardasa lord from dasa rasi. 
 
Another approach is to divide each dasa into three equal parts. The rasi dominates in 
the first part. Its lord dominates in the second part and gives his results. Occupants of 
the rasi and those who aspect it dominate in the third part.

 240 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 68: Let us consider the rasi chart of Bill Gates, the well-known billionaire 
of computer software giant Microsoft Corporation (s ee Chart 24). Lagna is stronger 
than the 7 th  house as its exalted lord aspects it. So dasas start from Ge. 
Chart 24 
 
 
Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Ge (04 years):  Oct 1955 - Oct 1959 
Aq (05 years):  Oct 1959 - Oct 1964 
Li (12 years):  Oct 1964 - Oct 1976 
Vi (12 years):  Oct 1976 - Oct 1988 
Ta (05 years):  Oct 1988 - Oct 1993 
Cp (04 years):  Oct 1993 - Oct 1997 
Sg (08 years):  Oct 1997 - Oct 2005 
 
During Cp dasa, Mr. Gates had a phenomenal rise in stature and finances. His 
company Microsoft became the powerhouse of computer  software. Why was Cp 
dasa such a good dasa? 
 
(1)  Cp contains raajya pada (A10 – arudha pada of the 10 
th  house). 

--- Page 253 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 241 
 
 
 
(2)  During Cp dasa, dasa lagna is Cp and paaka rasi is Li. Lord of dasa lagna is 
Saturn. He is exalted in the 10 
th  house with the 10 th  lord Venus (from dasa lagna). 
They form a powerful raja yoga w.r.t.  dasa lagna as well as paaka rasi. 
(3)  Exalted Mercury is in a trine from dasa lagna and J upiter is in 8 th  from dasa 
lagna. Rahu is in 11 th . Two powerful planets are in 10 th . All these are favorable 
placements. 
(4)  Sun owns the 8 th  house from dasa lagna and he is debilitated. 
 
At the time of writing this book, Mr. Gates is goin g through Sg dasa. How will Sg 
dasa be? 
 
(1)  Dasa lagna is Sg and paaka rasi is Le. The lord of dasa lagna is not particularly 
strong (not as strong as the previous dasa’s dasa l agna lord). But he is not weak 
either. So things can slow down. 
(2)  Dasa lagna lord Jupiter occupies the 9 
th  house suggesting some noble acts of 
charity. 
(3)  Rahu occupies the 12 th  house. This shows constant fear. (Microsoft Corpor ation 
is facing law suits from the federal government and  several state governments in 
US, for being a monopoly). 
(4)  Sun, the lord of the 9 th  house from dasa lagna, is debilitated. He is also the lord of 
paaka rasi. This can suggest some loss of fortune. 
(5)  However, other planets are favorably placed w.r.t. dasa lagna. The 10 th  and 11 th  
houses from dasa lagna are particularly strong. Exalted Mercury occupies the 10 th  
house from dasa lagna and he has a raaja yoga with Mars w.r.t.  dasa lagna. So 
Mr. Gates may continue to be a successful and innovative enterpreneur. 
 
Example 69: Let us consider the rasi chart of India’s independ ence chart and look at 
the 1990’s (see Chart 25). Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Ta (02 years):  Aug 1947 - Aug 1949 
Sg (10 years):  Aug 1949 - Aug 1959 
Cn (12 years):  Aug 1959 - Aug 1971 
Aq (07 years):  Aug 1971 - Aug 1978 
Vi (02 years):  Aug 1978 - Aug 1980 
Ar (02 years):  Aug 1980 - Aug 1982 
Sc (07 years):  Aug 1982 - Aug 1989 
Ge (01 years):  Aug 1989 - Aug 1990 
Cp (06 years):  Aug 1990 - Aug 1996 

--- Page 254 ---
  
 
 242 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Le (01 years):  Aug 1996 - Aug 1997 
Pi (05 years):  Aug 1997 - Aug 2002 
 
Chart 25 
 
 
Capricorn dasa runs during 1990-1996. Mars in the 6
th  house, Jupiter in the 10 th  
house and Ketu in the 11 th  house from dasa lagna are well-placed. Conglomeration of 
planets in the 7 th  house (relations with other nations) and Ketu in the 11 th  house gives 
gains from foreign sources. From paaka rasi also, R ahu is in the 11 th  house and it 
shows the same thing. So Indian economy was liberal ized. Jupiter in the 10 th  house 
shows a versatile, intelligent and knowledgable Bra hmin leader (Sri P.V. Narasimha 
Rao). Aspect of Mars on the analytical and tamasik rasi Vi containing the 9 th  house 
from dasa lagna made the judiciary system relativel y aggressive. This resulted in the 
probe into hawala 55  scam that shook national politics. 
 
While there was progress during 1990-1996 due to th e good placement of most 
planets w.r.t.  dasa lagna, India experienced disorder, confusion and instability during 
1996-1997. During this time, India had a minority g overnment formed by a 
                                                
 
55  Hawala means “bribes for favors” 

--- Page 255 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 243 
 
 
 
conglomeration of minor parties that formed a “thir d force” in Indian politics.  
During this period, India ran Le dasa. 
 
Dasa lagna during Le dasa is Le itself. Except Mars , no planet is well-placed w.r.t.  
Le. In particular, planetary conglomeration in the 12 
th  house shows constant fear and 
turbulence. It signals instability. Rahu in the 10 th  house from dasa lagna denies stable 
and capable leadership. 
 
During 1997-2002, India runs Pisces dasa. Most planets are well-placed w.r.t.  Pisces. 
So Pisces dasa is a better dasa. As Pisces is a con servative rasi, conservative thought 
may be predominant in the nation. Jupiter owns the 10 
th  house and Mars aspects it. 
So India has another learned and intelligent Brahmi n leader who has Martian 
strength in his horoscope (Sri A.B. Vajpayee). 
Chart 26 
 
 
Ketu in the 9 
th  house from dasa lagna may denote religious clashes  and violence. 
Mars in the 4 th  house may denote lack of comfort and the absence o f a feeling of 
well-being. These two are bad placements that stand  out. Rahu in the 3 rd  house from 
dasa lagna makes India very bold and assertive. Rah u in the 3 rd  can also give 

--- Page 256 ---
  
 
 244 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
aggressive weapon development, as the 3 rd  house shows weapons. India conducted 
nuclear tests in May 1998. Antardasas in Pisces das a start from Libra and proceed in 
the forward direction. Antardasa at the time of nuc lear tests was Sc. Sc aspects A3, 
which is in Ar. A3 shows the illusion related to bo ldness or the things based on 
which the world forms impression about one’s boldne ss, i.e.  one’s weapons. 
Antardasas aspecting A3 can bring weapons, just as antardasas aspecting UL can 
bring marriage. 
 
Exercise 28: The native of Chart 26 had an excellent career in India until 1997. Then 
he had to go to US with his wife, who is a software  engineer. He could not find the 
right job for his qualifications in US. He could no t succeed in his efforts to redeem 
his career. He had to depend on his wife and went t hrough a lot of hard times.

Narayana dasa may be calculated for vargas (divisio nal charts) also. Narayana dasa 
of a varga throws light on the progress of matters shown in that varga. For example, 
we can use Naryana dasa of D-4 to time changes in r esidence, happiness from home 
and stay in foreign countries. We can use Narayana dasa of D-10 to time events in 
career. We can use Narayana dasa of D-24 to time ev ents related to learning and 
knowledge. We can use Narayana dasa of D-9 to time marriage and to predict events 
in marital life. We can use Narayana dasa of D-7 to  predict happiness from children. 
We can use Narayana dasa of D-12 to predict relations with parents. 
 
Narayana dasa of vargas is computed a little differ ently. Each divisional chart is 
based on a seed house. The seed for D-n is the n
th  house. For example, the seed of D-
9 is the 9 th  house. D-9 shows dharma (duty). To get married, to  live with one’s 
spouse and to perform religious ceremonies with spo use are one’s duties or dharma. 
This is why Navamsa is also called Dharmamsa. The s eed of D-10 is the 10 th  house. 
That is why D-10 shows one’s karma or action in society. The seed of D-7 is the 7 th  
house. Sex is for procreation and begetting progeny . The seed of D-4 (house) and D-
16 (vehicles and pleasures) is the 4 th  house. D-12 in the physical plane (it shows the 
lineage one belongs to) and D-24 in the mental plan e (it shows one’s learning) show 
the evolution of one’s self in the respective plane s. They are both based on the 12 th 
house as the seed, which shows the evolution of self.

To get the seed of D- n, just take the n
th  house. For example, the seed of D-11 is the 
11 th  house. If n is greater than 12, subtract multiples of 12 from n. For example, the 
seed of D-16 is 16–12=4 th  house. The seed of D-27 is 27–24=3 rd  house. The seed of 
D-30 is 30–24=6 th  house. The seed of D-24 is 24–12=12 th  house. The seed of D-40 is 
40–36=4 th  house. 
 
Procedure : 
 
(1)  Find the seed house of the divisional chart of interest. 
(2)  Take that house in rasi chart. 
(3)  Find its lord. Take the stronger lord in the case of Aq and Sc. 
(4)  Take the rasi occupied by him in the divisional cha rt of interest as lagna and find 
Narayana dasa of the divisional chart just as if it  were a rasi chart. Use the rules 
explained in the previous sections. 
 
Warning on Interpretation : Narayana dasa of vargas is not  the progression of lagna 
or the 7 
th  house. So taking dasa rasi or the 7 th  from it as lagna and analyzing dasas is 
has no technical basis. It applies only the rasi chart. 
 
Example 70 : Suppose someone’s rasi chart has lagna in Cn. Sup pose we want 
Narayana dasa of D-10 to time some events in career . The 10 
th  house is the seed of 
D-10. The 10 th  house in rasi chart is Ar. Its lord is Mars. Suppo se D-10 has lagna in 
Ta and Mars in Vi. We ignore lagna in D-10 and trea t the rasi containing Mars in D-
10 as lagna and use the rules of Narayana dasa of r asi chart. So we treat Vi as lagna. 
We take the stronger of Vi and Pi as the dasa seed. Suppose Vi is stronger and it does 
not contain Saturn or Ketu. Then dasas go as Vi, Cp , Ta, Ge, Li, Aq etc . We find the 
lengths of dasas and antardasas taking D-10 and app lying the rules taught for rasi 
chart. 
 
Example 71: Let us time the foreign stay of the native of Char t 27 using Narayana 
dasa of D-4. Readers may recall that D-4 shows one’ s residence and fortune. It is the 
appropriate chart for timing foreign stay.

Chart 27 
 
 
Lagna is at 14 Vi 52. The 4 
th  house in rasi chart is Sg and Jupiter owns it. He 
occupies Cp in D-4. Let us treat Cp as lagna. So da sa seed is the stronger rasi of Cp 
and Cn (which is the 7 th  from Cp). As 2 planets occupy Cp, it is stronger t han Cn. So 
dasas start from Cp. Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Cp (04 years):  Apr 1970 - Apr 1974 
Sg (00 years):  — 
Sc (03 years):  Apr 1974 - Apr 1977 
Li (09 years):  Apr 1977 - Apr 1986 
Vi (05 years):  Apr 1986 - Apr 1991 
Le (11 years):  Apr 1991 - Apr 2002 
 
N
OTES : 
 
(1)  Saturn is in the 4 
th  house from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction because 
Cp is an even-footed rasi. We get 4–1=3. However, S aturn is exalted and we 
have to add one year. So Cp dasa is of 4 years. 

--- Page 259 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 247 
 
 
 
(2)  Jupiter is in the 2 
nd  house from Sg. We get 2–1=1. However, Jupiter is debilitated 
and we have to subtract one year. So Sg dasa is of zero years. However, Sg dasa 
of 12 years will come in the second cycle. 
 
We can see that Le is the 9 
th  house. The 9 th  house shows prospering in a foreign land. 
Rahu signifies foreign things and he occupies Le. E xalted 12 th  lord Mars aspects Le. 
For these reasons, Le dasa is a natural candidate f or giving foreign stay. We can see 
that 11-year Le dasa started in April 1991. The nat ive moved from his motherland to 
US on 15 th  August 1991 for higher studies. He is working as a  software engineer in 
US now. 
 
Antardasa: To find antardasas in Le dasa, we should take the stronger of Le and Aq. 
Both have one planet each. Le is aspected by Mercur y and Jupiter, while Aq is 
aspected by Mercury and its co-lord Saturn. Neither  contains an exalted planet. Aq is 
an odd sign and its stronger lord is also in an odd  sign. On the other hand, Le is an 
odd sign and its lord is in an even sign. So Le is stronger and antardasas start from 
the rasi containing Sun – the lord of Le. So antard asas start from Vi. Because Vi is 
an even sign, they go in the backward direction. An tardasas of 11 months go as Le, 
Vi, Cn, Ge etc . The native went abroad in Vi antardasa containing Sun. Sun owns the 
9
th  house in D-4 and owns the 12 th  house in rasi chart. Lord of Vi is Mercury and he 
occupies the 9 th  house from dasa rasi. 
 
Pratyantardasa: Vi is stronger than Pi, as it has a planet. Lord of  Vi is Mercury. He 
is in Ar – an odd rasi. So pratyantardasas in Vi an tardasa go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le 
etc . Vi antardasa is of 11 months and it runs from 4 
th  April 1991 to 4 th  March 1992. 
Dividing it into 12 equal parts, we see that the 5 th  pratyantardasa runs from 27 th  July 
1991 to 25 th  August 1991. So Le pratyantardasa was running when  the native landed 
in US. Le is the 9 th  house containing Rahu. 
 
Example 72: Let us consider the navamsa chart of a lady who go t married in mid-
1993 (see Chart 28). 
 
Lagna in rasi chart is Li. The seed for navamsa (D- 9) is the 9 
th  house. The 9 th  lord in 
rasi chart is Mercury. He is in Ge in navamsa and G e is stronger than Sg. So dasas 
start from Ge. Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Ge (12 years):  Sep 1971 - Sep 1983 
Aq (08 years):  Sep 1983 - Sep 1991 

--- Page 260 ---
  
 
 248 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Li (02 years):  Sep 1991 - Sep 1993 
Chart 28 
 
 
When she got married in August 1993, she was runnin g Li’s Navamsa Narayana 
dasa. Why did Li’s dasa give marriage? 
 
Lagna in navamsa shows self, from the point of view  of dharma and marital life. So 
lagna’s dasa is favorable for marriage. Dasas of th e 1 
st , 3 rd  and 8 th  houses from 
upapada (UL) are also favorable for marriage. On th e other hand, dasas of 6 th  house 
from lagna, dasas of the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses from UL can bring troubles in marriage 
and even a divorce when the chart has such indications. Because UL shows marriage, 
the 1 st , 3 rd  and 8 th  houses from it show its birth, vitality and life (longevity). The 2 nd  
and 7 th  houses from it show its end. 
 
Here Li is lagna. So its dasa can certainly bring marriage. 
 
Example 73: Let us consider the navamsa chart of another lady and guess when she 
got married. See Chart 29. 
 

--- Page 261 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 249 
 
 
 
Lagna is at 4 Vi 08. So the 9 
th  house in rasi chart is Ta. Lord is Venus. He is in  Pi in 
Navamsa. Vi is stronger than Pi, as its lord Mercur y aspects it. So dasas start from 
Vi. Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Vi (09 years):  Jul 1969 - Jul 1978 
Cp (05 years):  Jul 1978 - Jul 1983 
Ta (11 years):  Jul 1983 - Jul 1994 
Ge (06 years):  Jul 1994 - Jul 2000 
 
Chart 29 
 
 
Dasas of lagna and UL do not run at the ages when m arriage is likely. Dasa of 
Taurus runs from the age of 14 years to 25 years. T aurus is the 3 
rd  from UL and its 
lord is exalted in UL. So Taurus dasa can give marr iage. Which antardasa can give 
marriage? Certainly, Aq with lagna and UL lord is a strong candidate and Pi with UL 
and exalted Venus (significator of marriage) is an even stronger candidate. 
 
As Sc is aspected by co-lord Ketu, it is stronger t han Ta. However, Mars is the 
stronger lord of Sc, as he is aspected by Mercury a nd his dispositor (Mercury again). 

--- Page 262 ---
  
 
 250 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Ketu is aspected only by his dispositor (Saturn) an d Mars’ count of 2 beats Ketu’s 
count of 1. So antardasas start from Vi. The 7 th  antardasa belongs to Pi. Each 
antardasa is of 11 months and the 7 th  antardasa starts after 5.5 years. It runs during 
Jan-Dec 1989. The lady got married in May 1989. So Pi antardasa brought marriage. 
 
Exercise 29: Consider the lady whose Navamsa is given in Chart 30. Despite wise 
counsel by elders, this lady insisted on leaving he r husband and ended her marriage 
in early June 2000. Find the antardasa running then  as per Navamsa Narayana dasa 
and explain the event. 
Chart 30 
 
 
Example 74:  Let us consider the D-10 of an electrical engineer  who faced some 
setbacks in career during 1994-1996 (see Chart 31). His enemies conspired and laid a 
trap for him and he was suspended by the government  from his job for a mistake he 
did not make. He had to suffer for a long time. 
 

--- Page 263 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 251 
 
 
 
Lagna is at 16 Aq 50. The 10 
th  house in rasi chart is Sc and Mars is its lord. Ma rs is 
in Cp in D-10. Cn is stronger than Cp, as Jupiter o ccupies it and its lord Moon 
aspects it. Narayana dasa starts from Cn and the calculations are given below: 
 
Cn (03 years):  Sep 1947 - Sep 1950 
Ge (11 years):  Sep 1950 - Sep 1961 
Ta (11 years):  Sep 1961 - Sep 1972 
Ar (10 years):  Sep 1972 - Sep 1982 
Pi (09 years):  Sep 1982 - Sep 1991 
Aq (05 years):  Sep 1991 - Sep 1996 
Chart 31 
 
 
The setbacks occurred in Aq dasa. Why is Aq a bad dasa? 
 
Aq is the 8 
th  house from lagna in D-10 and it gives tension, fru stration, worries and 
setbacks (related to career). It is the 12 th  house of losses from AL, showing some 
setbacks in professional status. The 2 nd  and 5 th  houses and also Sun show recognition 
from authorities in a chart. Sun owns the 2 nd  house here and he is in Aq, afflicted by 
enemy Rahu. Affliction of Sun by Rahu in dasa rasi can show scandals and making a 
bad name with authorities. Aquarius has Satru pada (arudha pada of 6 th  house) and it 

--- Page 264 ---
  
 
 252 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
can show trouble from enemies. Because of the exalt ation of Saturn in a quadrant, 
the middle part of this dasa must be good. Because the occupants of a rasi dominate 
the last one-third of a dasa, that was when Sun and Rahu gave the troubles. 
 
Exercise 30:  Consider the gentleman whose D-10 is given in Char t 32. Find 
Dasamsa Narayana dasa running in 1996-1998 and judg e whether that period should 
be good or bad for his career. 
Chart 32 
 
 
Example 75:  Let us consider the native whose D-16 is given in Chart 33. D-16 
shows vehicles, comforts and discomforts. The nativ e had a vehicular accident in 
December 1996. Let us find the antardasa running th en and see if the event makes 
sense. 
 
Lagna is at 14 Vi 52. The seed of D-16 is the 4 
th  house, as 16–12=4. The 4 th  lord in 
Rasi chart is Jupiter. In D-16, he is in Vi and Vi is stronger than Pi. So dasas start 
from Vi. Narayana dasa calculations of D-16 are given below: 
 

--- Page 265 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 253 
 
 
 
Vi (04 years):  Apr 1970 - Apr 1974 
Cp (01 years):  Apr 1974 - Apr 1975 
Ta (03 years):  Apr 1975 - Apr 1978 
Ge (11 years):  Apr 1978 - Apr 1989 
Li (10 years):  Apr 1989 - Apr 1999 
Chart 33 
 
 
In Li dasa, antardasas start from the lord of Li or  Ar. Li is aspected by Mercury and 
its lord Venus and it is stronger. Its lord Venus i s in Le, an odd rasi. So antardasas 
start from Le and go in the forward direction. Li d asa started in April 1989 and this 
event happened in December 1996. From April 1989 to  December 1996, a period of 
7 years and 8 months (7 
x12+8=92 months) passed. Each antardasa is of 10 months as 
Li dasa is of 10 years. So 9 antardasas finish afte r 90 months and the 10 th  antardasa 
runs in the 92 nd  month. The 10 th  house from Le is Ta. Why did Ta antardasa bring an  
accident? 
 
Ta is the 12 
th  from vahanapada (A4 – arudha pada of the 4 th  house). It can give losses 
to the vehicle. Lord of A4 is Mercury and he is with Rahu and Ketu in Ta. So vehicle 
can be involved in an accident. Moreover, mrityu pa da (A8) is in Ta and troubles 

--- Page 266 ---
  
 
 254 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
related to vehicles can be expected. Nobody was hur t in the accident, but the car was 
badly damaged and the native was given a new car by  his insurance company. In the 
next 6 months, his new car was damaged twice while parked in a parking lot. One of 
the damages was serious. So Ta antardasa continued to give vehicular troubles. 
 
One may wonder why we are looking at antardasa and not mahadasa. Events shown 
by mahadasa suggest the overall mood of the whole 1 0 year period, while events 
shown by antardasa are applicable to 10 months here . With Li being the 4 
th  house 
and having the argala of lord Venus, the native had  the comfort of vehicles in Li 
dasa. However, Ta antardasa was bad due to Rahu and  A8. Based on the event of 
interest, we should judiciously choose mahadasa or antardasa or pratyantardasa for 
examination. If an event plays a role in a native’s  life for just a week, it is probably 
shown in pratyantardasa. If an event plays a role in a native’s life for a few months, it 
is probably shown in antardasa. Mahadasa shows the mood of longer periods. If we 
want to analyze a temporary activity that remains i n a native’s mind for just an hour, 
it is probably seen in the praana-antardasa or deha -antardasa running then. We 
should determine the effective period of an event a nd judiciously choose the dasa 
division in which it should be seen. 
 
18.6  Sub-divisions of Narayana Dasa 
 
Narayana dasa is a versatile rasi dasa. It is a gen eral purpose phalita dasa. It can be 
computed separately for each divisional chart for p recise timing of events related to 
the matters associated with that divisional chart. We can go down to the precision of 
a day or an hour by using fine sub-divisions of das as. As in Example 71, we can 
divide each antardasa into 12 equal pratyantardasas . This is done in the same manner 
as each dasa is divided into 12 equal antardasas. I n the same manner, we can divide 
each pratyantardasa into 12 equal sookshma-antardas as (or simply sookshma dasas), 
each sookshma-antardasa into 12 equal praana-antard asas (or simply praana dasas) 
and each praana-antardasa into 12 equal deha-antardasas. 
 
When we say that a period is divided into 12 equal  sub-periods, what do we mean by 
“equal”? We obviously mean that the twelve sub-peri ods have the same length. The 
next question is — how do we measure the length of a sub-period? In days, hours, 
minutes and seconds? No! We measure the length of a  period (or a sub-period) by 
the angle of the arc traversed by Sun during that p eriod (or sub-period). Two periods 
are said to be equal if and only if Sun moves by th e same degrees, minutes and 

--- Page 267 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 255 
 
 
 
seconds during the two periods. In other words, we take 1 year=12 months and 1 
month=30 days, where 1 day is the time in which Sun moves by 1º. 
 
Motion of Sun is the basis for measuring time in ra si dasas. Suppose a dasa of 5 
years starts after the native completes 37 years. I f Sun is at 23 ° 50' 25'' in Aq in the 
birthchart of a native born in 1960, he finishes 37  years when Sun reaches the same 
longitude in 1997. If the dasa is of 5 years, each antardasa is of 5 months. This 
corresponds to the time in which Sun moves by 5 
x30º=150º. When each antardasa 
divided into 12 equal pratyantardasas, Sun moves by  exactly 150º/12=12 °30' during 
each pratyantardasa. 
 
Thus we should divide time in the space of Sun’s longitude when dividing dasas upto 
praana-antardasas or deha-antardasas. Then only cor rect results will be obtained. A 
free  software program for computers using Microsoft Win dows operating systems 
can be downloaded at 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org . Given the birthdata and the 
start year and length of a mahadasa, this software program can divide the mahadasa 
upto the level of deha-antardasas using Sun’s longitude as the measure of time. 
 
18.7  Conclusion 
 
Narayana dasa may be said to be the most important phalita dasa. Its versatility lies 
in the fact that it can be computed separately for each divisional chart for precise 
timing of specific matters. In fact, we can compute  more than one Narayana dasa for 
each divisional chart. Narayana dasa of D-12 seeded  from the 12 
th  lord is native-
centric. It shows events in a native’s life that ar e related to parents. Even when 
looking at the events in the lives of parents, it t akes the native as the reference. To 
see events in the lives of parents directly, we can  use different seeds. Similarly, 12 th  
house used as the seed in D-24 Narayana dasa shows the learning from the point of 
view of one’s evolution. One can use the 4 th  house (formal learning) as the seed in 
D-24 Narayana dasa to see formal education. By usin g a different seed, we can 
examine the events related to the chosen divisional  chart from a different angle. 
Readers should try to master this fantastic dasa system.

 256 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Exercise 27: 
 
The 7 
th  house has 2 planets and lagna has only one. So the  7 th  house acts as dasa 
seed. Progression for Aq is: every 6 th . Because Li (9 th  from Aq) is odd-footed, 
direction is normally “forward”. But Ketu’s presenc e in Aq reverses it and makes it 
“backward”. Saturn acts as the lord of Aq and Ketu as the lord of Sc. Dasas go as: 
 
Aq (02 years):  Nov 1960 - Nov 1962 
Vi (11 years):  Nov 1962 - Nov 1973 
Ar (02 years):  Nov 1973 - Nov 1975 
Sc (03 years):  Nov 1975 - Nov 1978 
Ge (04 years):  Nov 1978 - Nov 1982 
Cp (01 years):  Nov 1982 - Nov 1983 
Le (09 years):  Nov 1983 - Nov 1992 
Pi (03 years):  Nov 1992 - Nov 1995 
Li (02 years):  Nov 1995 - Nov 1997 
Ta (07 years):  Nov 1997 - Nov 2004 
Sg (12 years):  Nov 2004 - Nov 2016 
Cn (05 years):  Nov 2016 - Nov 2021 
 
Aq (10 years):  Nov 2021 - Nov 2031 
Vi (01 years):  Nov 2031 - Nov 2032 
Ar (10 years):  Nov 2032 - Nov 2042 
Sc (09 years):  Nov 2042 - Nov 2051 
Ge (08 years):  Nov 2051 - Nov 2059 
Cp (11 years):  Nov 2059 - Nov 2070 
Le (03 years):  Nov 2070 - Nov 2073 
Pi (09 years):  Nov 2073 - Nov 2082 
 
We stop here because 120 years is the paramayush of human beings. 
 
Exercise 28: 
 
Both Ge and Sg are unoccupied. Neither is occupied or aspected by Jupiter, Mercury 
or lord. Ge is an odd rasi and Mercury is also in a n odd rasi. But Sg is an odd rasi 
and Jupiter is in an even rasi. So Sg is stronger. Narayana dasa calculations are given 
below: 
 
Sg (11 years):  May 1971 - May 1982 
Le (05 years):  May 1982 - May 1987 
Ar (10 years):  May 1987 - May 1997 
Pi (04 years):  May 1997 - May 2001

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 257 
 
 
 
Sc (03 years):  May 2001 - May 2004 
 
Because we started dasas from the 7 
th  house instead of lagna, Narayana dasa shows 
the progression of the 7 th  house instead of lagna. So dasa lagna is the 7 th  from dasa 
rasi. During Ar dasa, dasa lagna is Li. Due to the exaltation of dasa lagna lord Venus 
(among other things), it was a very good dasa. Duri ng Pi dasa, dasa lagna is Vi. Lord 
of Vi is Mercury and he is in the 8 th  house from it. Lords of two dusthanas – Mars 
and Sun – are exalted and that suggests hard times.  Jupiter in the 3 rd  from dasa lagna 
suggests failures. There are no malefics in the 3 rd  or 6 th  from dasa lagna. Saturn in 
the 9 th  house suggests loss of fortune or struggle for for tune in far away places. Ketu 
in the 11 th  house shows gains from foreign sources. Exalted 9 th  lord Venus is in the 
7th  house. So he went abroad following his wife. 
 
Exercise 29: 
 
Lagna is at 0 Sc 39. Moon is the 9 
th  lord in rasi chart. He is in Aq. Le is stronger than 
Aq because Sun is more advanced in his rasi than Sa turn. Dasas start from Le. 
Because of the presence of Saturn in Le, they go in  the regular zodiacal order. 
Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 
Le (02 years):  Jun 1976 - Jun 1978 
Vi (08 years):  Jun 1978 - Jun 1986 
Li (07 years):  Jun 1986 - Jun 1993 
Sc (10 years):  Jun 1993 - Jun 2003 
 
Let us find antardasas in Sc dasa. Ta is stronger t han Sc. Lord of Ta is Venus. He is 
in Ta itself. So antardasas start from Ta. Because Ta is an even rasi, antardasas go in 
the backward order. Each antardasa lasts 10 months.  It takes 80 months (or 6 years 
and 8 months) for 8 antardasas to finish. So the 9 
th  antardasa starts in February 2000 
and runs for 8 months. The 9 th  antardasa belongs to the 9 th  house from Ta in the 
backward direction. It is Vi. 
 
Vi is the 2 
nd  house from UL and it shows the end of marriage. Ke tu occupies it and 
Sun, Mars and Rahu aspect it. Because of these male fic influences, Vi periods can 
break her marriage. Sun’s aspect on the 2 nd  from UL can denote father’s influence in 
the break-up. This lady encountered resistance from  mother and maternal relatives, 
but her father encouraged her to end the marriage.

Cancer dasa was running in 1996-1998. Is it good or bad? 
 
Cancer is the 5 
th  house from lagna and it shows recognition. It cont ains AL in D-10 
and shows status in career. Cancer has argalas and rasi aspects from lagna lord 
Jupiter and Sun. Moreover, it has bhaagya pada (A9 – arudha pada of the 9 th  house). 
A9 shows the illusion associated with fortune (in c areer, because this is D-10). It 
shows the things based on which people form impress ion about one’s fortune. It 
essentially shows the trappings of fortune, like good position and money. Dasa of A9 
in D-10 can give excellent position in career. So this period must have been excellent 
for the native’s career. 
 
In fact, it was. The native owned a private company  specializing in computer 
software and hardware for a niche market. He sold h is company to a large 
corporation for several millions of dollars in Febr uary 1997 and became a Vice 
President of that corporation. It was predicted to him by this author in mid-1996 that 
a very important event in his professional and fina ncial life would take place in the 
middle of February 1997.

19.  Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa 
 
19.1  Introduction 
 
There is a dasa called “Kendradi Graha Dasa” or “Mo ola dasa”, which goes through 
the dasas of planets in quadrants, panapharas and a poklimas from the stronger of 
lagna and Moon (some authors include Sun). Vimsotta ri dasa years with 
moolatrikona correction are used. According to some  authors, this dasa is applicable 
to all people. In particular, if there are 4 planet s in quadrants from the stronger of 
lagna and Moon, this dasa gives much better results than Vimsottari dasa. 
 
Moola dasa is beyond the scope of this book. But we will cover a similar dasa, which 
belongs to rasis instead of planets. It is called “ Kendradi Rasi Dasa”. In particular, 
we will cover “Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa”. 
 
Kendra means “quadrants” and adi means “starting wi th”. In this dasa, we cover the 
rasis in quadrants from lagna first and then cover panapharas and apoklimas. 
 
This is a phalita dasa that shows material success well. 
 
19.2  Computation 
 
(1)  Dasas start from the stronger of lagna and 7 
th  house. Let us call this rasi “dasa 
seed”. 
(2)  The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or back ward based on whether lagna 
is in an odd sign or an even sign. If Saturn is in the stronger of lagna and 7 th , dasa 
order is forward. If Ketu is in the stronger of lagna and 7 th , dasa order is reversed. 
NOTE : We are talking about odd and even signs here and not  about odd-footed 
and even-footed signs. 
(3)  First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1 st , 4 th , 7th  and 10 th ) from dasa seed. 
(4)  Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2 nd , 5 th , 8 th  and 11 th ) from dasa seed. 

--- Page 272 ---
  
 
 260 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(5)  Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3 rd , 6 th , 9 th  and 12 th ) from dasa seed. 
(6)  Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system a re found just like in Narayana 
dasa. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ge and Ge is stronger than Sg. Then dasas start from Ge. 
Because Ge is an odd sign, we go in the forward order and get dasa order as: 
 
Ge (1 
st ), Vi (4 th ), Sg (7 th ) , Pi (10 th ), Cn (2 nd ), Li (5 th ), Cp (8 th ) , Ar (11 th ), Le (3 rd ), Sc 
(6 th ), Aq (9 th ) , Ta(12 th ). 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ta and Ta is stronger than Sc. Then dasas start from Ta. Because 
Ta is an even sign, we go in the backward  order and count houses in the backward 
direction. We get dasa order as: 
 
Ta (1 
st ), Aq (4 th ), Sc (7 th ) , Le (10 th ), Ar (2 nd ), Cp (5 th ), Li (8 th ) , Cn (11 th ), Pi (3 rd ), Sg 
(6 th ), Vi (9 th ) , Ge (12 th ). 
 
19.3  Interpretation 
 
Parasara taught that the quadrants are ruled by Sri  Maha Vishnu and the trines are 
ruled by Sri Maha Lakshmi. If we cover the trines o f lagna, then go to the trines of 
another quadrant and cover all the 12 signs in that  fashion ( i.e.  as the trines from 
quadrants), that sequence is quadrant-based and hen ce Narayana rules it. This 
progression is seen for dual signs in Narayana dasa . On the other hand, if we cover 
the quadrants of lagna first, then go to the quadra nts of 5 
th /9 th  and finally cover the 
quadrants of the 3 rd  trine, then the sequence is trine-based and Sri Lakshmi rules it. 
 
In other words, the sequence 1 
st , 5 th , 9 th , 10 th  etc is quadrant-based and it is ruled by 
Narayana. The sequence 1 st , 4 th , 7 th , 10 th  is trine-based and it is ruled by Lakshmi. 
 
So Kendradi rasi dasa uses the movement ruled by La kshmi. Lakshmi is the goddess 
of wealth and prosperity. So this dasa shows the pe riods of prosperity. It shows the 
progression of lagna using the movement ruled by Sri Lakshmi.

N
OTE : We will learn Sudasa in a later chapter. Sudasa i s also a Kendradi Rasi Dasa, 
but started from Sree Lagna instead of lagna. Sree Lagna is the Lakshmi sthana 56  in a 
horoscope. So its progression using the movement ru led by Sri Lakshmi is more 
important. 
 
Example 76: Let us consider the horoscope of former US Preside nt Ronald Reagan 
(see Chart 34). 
 
Chart 34 
 
 
Lagna is in Sc. Ta is stronger than Sc, as it has J upiter’s aspect. So dasas start from 
Ta. Because Ta is an even rasi, we go anti-zodiacal ly. Dasas go as shown in Table 
41. 
 
Table 41: Dasa years

Dasas from Ta to Pi add up to 65 years and run duri ng 1911-1976. Sg dasa runs 
during 1976-1986. Mr. Reagan became US President in 1980. Why did Sg dasa bring 
such success? 
 
(1)  Usually rasis containing AK give success. Sg has AK. 
(2)  Signs having a strong argala of AmK show coming und er the decisive influence 
of good advisors, ministers and bureaucrats. We fin d in the charts of politicians 
that rasis having strong argalas from AmK give poli tical power. That is because 
political power usually brings a leader in the comp any of excellent advisors, 
ministers, secretaries or bureaucrats. Here Sg has an unobstructed argala from 
AmK Sun, who is in the 2 
nd  from Sg in Gopuramsa with 6 rekhas in 
ashtakavarga. This shows very capable political advisors. 
(3)  More than anything else, Sg has GL. GL is the seat of power in a chart. 
(4)  Lagna lord Mars is in Sg and he connects lagna to GL. 
 
19.4  Conclusion 
 
This dasa shows material success as it is based on a movement ruled by Sri Maha 
Lakshmi. It may be used in conjunction with Sudasa to predict material success. 
However, Sudasa is a superior dasa. 
 
A noted author who wrote a book on “Mandooka dasa” made some changes to 
“Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa” and presented it as “Man dooka dasa”. However the 
quadrants-panapharas-apoklimas movement is called “ kendraadi gati” and certainly 
not  mandooki gati. Mandooki gati was clearly explained  by Parasara in his 
discussion on Kalachakra dasa and it is the 3 
rd /11 th  jump. Mandooka dasa is based on 
mandooki gati and Mandooka dasa of Rudramsa is used  for predicting the results of 
wars and death. The dasa presented by the gentleman  in question is certainly not 
Mandooka dasa. It is only a variation  of the dasa discussed in this chapter.

20.  Sudasa 
 
20.1  Introduction 
 
Sudasa is a rasi dasa. It is also called “Sree Lagn a Kendradi Rasi Dasa” or simply 
“Rasi Dasa”. Its computation is based on kendras etc  from Sree Lagna. Sudasa is 
important for materialistic things like money, powe r and authority. It can be used to 
predict financial matters and matters related to st atus and power. If a political leader 
occupies a post of power, he must be enjoying a fav orable dasa as per Sudasa. If a 
businessman sees increasing profits, he must be enj oying a favorable dasa as per 
Sudasa. If someone struggles with tight finances, h e must be going through an 
unfavorable dasa as per Sudasa. 
 
20.2  Computation 
 
(1)  In Sudasa, dasas start from the sign containing Sre e Lagna (see the chapter on 
special lagnas). 
(2)  The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or back ward based on whether SL is 
in an odd sign or an even sign. 
N
OTE : We are talking about odd and even signs here and not  about odd-footed 
and even-footed signs. 
(3)  First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1 st , 4 th , 7 th  and 10 th ) from SL. 
(4)  Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2 nd , 5 th , 8 th  and 11 th ) from SL. 
(5)  Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3 rd , 6 th , 9 th  and 12 th ) from SL. 
(6)  Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system a re found just like in Narayana 
dasa. 
(7)  But there is an exception in the case of first dasa . Only a fraction of first dasa is 
left at birth. This fraction is found using the formula: (30 ° – SL’s advancement in 
its sign)/30 °. 
 

--- Page 276 ---
  
 
 264 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 77:  Consider Sri Vajpayee’s rasi chart shown in Chart 3. His SL is at 
12 °21' in Capricorn. 
 
(1)  Dasas start from Capricorn, the sign containing SL. 
(2)  Because Capricorn is an even sign, the direction of reckoning dasas is backward . 
(3)  First 4 dasas will belong to kendras from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction. 
They are Cp, Li, Cn and Ar. 
(4)  Next 4 dasas will belong to panapharas from Cp, rec koned in the backward 
direction. They are Sg, Vi, Ge and Pi. 
(5)  Last 4 dasas will belong to apoklimas from Cp, reck oned in the backward 
direction. They are Sc, Le, Ta and Aq. 
(6)  Dasa periods are found as in Narayana dasa. We get dasa periods as: 
Cp: 2 years 
Li: 2 years 
Cn: 11 years 
Ar: 12 years 
Sg: 2 years 
Vi: 10 years 
Ge: 5 years 
Pi: 1 year 
Sc: 2 years 
Le: 8 years 
Ta: 7 years 
Aq: 3 years 
(7)  SL is at 12 °21' in Capricorn. The fraction of the first dasa le ft at birth = (30 ° – 
12 °21'/30 ° = (1800 – 741)/1800 = 0.5883. 
First dasa of Cp is of 2 years and 0.5883 of it is 1.1766 years, i.e. , 1 year 2 
months 3 days 14 hours. So this is the remainder of  Cp dasa at birth. After this, 
Li dasa of 2 years will start. 
20.3  Interpretation 
 

--- Page 277 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 265 
 
 
 
(1)  Dasas of HL, 7 
th  from HL and the signs aspecting HL bring financial prosperity. 
If the lord of the dasa sign occupies or aspects HL , it will improve the chance of 
financial prosperity. Similarly, if the lord of HL occupies or aspects dasa sign, it 
will also improve the chances of financial prosperity. 
For example, say HL is in Aries, Mars is in Leo and  Sun is in Scorpio. Then ( a) 
Leo aspects HL, ( b) lord of Leo aspects HL and ( c) lord of HL occupies Leo. So 
Leo dasa is triply likely to bring financial prosperity. 
(2)  Same thing holds for GL and the prescribed results are power and authority 
instead of financial prosperity. 
(3)  Upachayas from any house stand for the growth of ma tters signified by that 
house. AL stands for one’s status. So dasas of upac hayas from AL bring growth 
of status. Dasa of the 11 th  house from AL is particularly favorable. 
(4)  The 8 th  and 12 th  houses from AL bring setbacks to one’s status. The ir dasas can 
be unfavorable. 
Example 78: Consider Sri Vajpayee, whose Sudasa was calculated  in Example 77. 
His GL is in Cancer. Capricorn is the 7 th  house from GL and it can bring power and 
authority. Its lord Saturn aspects GL. Moon is the lord of GL and he aspects Cp. So 
Cp dasa is very favorable for attaining a position of power and authority. Moreover, 
Cp contains AL and A5. AL shows status and A5 can s how power. The 5 th  house 
shows one’s following. A5 shows things based on whi ch the world forms an 
impression about one’s following. It can show the t rappings of power. Capricorn 
dasa in the second cycle made him the Prime Minister of India. 
 
Of course, Narayana is important for power, though Sri Lakshmi gives prosperity. So 
we should always check Narayana dasa along with Sud asa. Sri Vajpayee was 
running the Narayana dasa of Sc during the same tim e and so he became the Prime 
Minister. Scorpio is lagna and houses a powerful ra ja yoga between AK (Mercury) 
and PK (Saturn). We studied in the chapter “Yogas” that the conjunction of AK and 
PK is a raja yoga, especially in 1 
st  and 5 th . 
 
Example 79: Consider Indian political leader Jayalalita’s char t shown in Chart 35. 
She was the Chief Minister of an important state in south India during 1991-1996.

Chart 35 
 
 
Her SL is in 22 Sg 22. So dasas start from Sg. Because Sg is an odd sign, counting of 
houses is in the zodiacal direction. Dasas go as Sg , Pi, Ge, Vi (quadrants); Cp, Ar, 
Cn, Li (panapharas); Aq, Ta, Le, Sc (apoklimas). Th e first dasa of Sg is of 12 years, 
because its lord Jupiter is in Sg. But SL is at 22 °22' in Sg and the remainder in first 
dasa at birth is 12 
x (30 ° – 22 °22')/30 ° = 12 x 0.2544 years =  3 years 19 days. After 
that, 3 years of Pi dasa, 8 years of Ge dasa, 7 yea rs of Vi dasa, 6 years of Cp dasa, 4 
years of Ar dasa, 11 years of Cn dasa and 6 years o f Li dasa follow. Li dasa ran 
during Feb 1990-Feb 1996. 
 
As Libra contains AL, GL and HL, its dasa as per Su dasa must give status, power 
and wealth. No wonder the native became a powerful Chief Minister.

21.  Drigdasa 
 
21.1  Introduction 
 
Drigdasa is a rasi dasa. Drik means vision and drig dasa is a dasa based on aspects. It 
shows how spiritual vision develops in a native and  steers one’s life. If a native’s 
chart promises spiritual growth, this dasa shows re ligious and spiritual activities and 
the evolution of one’s soul. 
 
21.2  Computation 
 
(1)  Dasas start from the 9 
th  house. 
(2)  First 4 dasas belong to the 9 th  house and the 3 signs aspected by it. Order of 
reckoning is forward or backward based on whether t he 9 th  house is odd-footed 
or even-footed. 
(3)  Next 4 dasas belong to the next house (10 th  house) and the 3 signs aspected by it. 
Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on whether the 10 th  house is 
odd-footed or even-footed. 
(4)  Last 4 dasas belong to the house after that (11 th  house) and the 3 signs aspected 
by it. Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on whether the 11 th  house 
is odd-footed or even-footed. 
(5)  Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system a re found just like in Narayana 
dasa. 
Example 80: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36. His lagna is i n Libra. Ge is the 9 th  
house, Cn is the 10 th  house and Le is the 11 th  house.  
 
(1)  Dasas start from the 9 
th  house, i.e. , Ge. 
(2)  Because Ge is an odd-footed sign, we should go forward as Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li etc  
and find the signs that aspect Ge. We get Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi. 

--- Page 280 ---
  
 
 268 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(3)  Next 4 dasas will belong to the 10 th  house (Cn) and rasis aspected by it. Because 
Cn is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as  Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Pi etc  and 
find the signs that aspect Cn. We get Cn, Ta, Aq and Sc. 
(4)  Last 4 dasas will belong to the 11 th  house (Le) and rasis aspected by it. Because 
Le is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as  Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar etc  and 
find the signs that aspect Le. We get Le, Ar, Cp and Li. 
(5)  So dasas go as Ge, Vi, Sg, Pi, Cn, Ta, Aq, Sc, Le, Ar, Cp and Li. Dasa periods of 
individual signs are found just as in Narayana dasa. 
Chart 36 
 
 
So we get the following as the dasa table: 
 
Ge: 4 years 
Vi: 11 years 
Sg: 2 years 
Pi: 1 year 
Cn: 6 years 
Ta: 3 years 
Aq: 8 years

Sc: 10 years 
Le: 11 years 
Ar: 5 years 
Cp: 7 years 
Li: 10 years 
 
21.3  Interpretation 
 
(1)  Dasa of arudha lagna can bring renunciation if ther e are parivraja yogas in the 
chart, indicating renunciation. 
(2)  Dasas of signs aspecting arudha lagna can bring ext ernal activities that are 
important for one’s spiritual evolution. 
(3)  Dasa of lagna and the 7 
th  house can bring internal awakening and self-
realization. 
(4)  Dasa of lagna can also bring fame and power related  to spreading spiritual 
knowledge. A monk may, for example, become the Chief Pontiff of a monastery. 
(5)  Dasas of signs containing or aspecting mantrapada ( A5, arudha pada of the 5 th  
house) can bring a religious initiation or sadhana (rigorous practice) of a mantra. 
(6)  Dasa of the sign containing mrityupada (A8, arudha pada of 8 th  house) can bring 
yogic sadhana. It can activate Kundalini sakti. 
(7)  Ketu is the significator of moksha (final liberatio n). Dasa of the sign containing 
Ketu can bring spiritual activities that take one t owards liberation. Ketu is the 
only planet who can give real spiritual awakening and liberation. 
(8)  Dasa of the sign containing Rahu can create progres s after internal turmoil if 
Rahu is favorable. If Rahu is unfavorable, it can t ake the native in the direction 
of materialism. 
 
Example 81: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36, whose Drigdasa  was computed in 
Example 80. Let us analyze Ta dasa that comes durin g 24-27 years of age. Ta has 
mokshakaraka Ketu in it. Lagna and mantrapada are i n Li and Ta aspects both. 
Because of these reasons, Ta dasa can bring interna l progress and spiritual evolution. 
It can make the native learn and use mantras.

Example 82:  Chart 37 gives the rasi chart of an ISKCON 57  devotee who was 
disillusioned with the materialistic world, left hi s education in mathematics at a 
Russian university, wandered in the forests for a f ew months and then found 
ISKCON. He was introduced to ISKCON and moved to a monastery in 1990. 
Chart 37 
 
 
Lagna is in Aq. The 9 
th  house is in Li. It is an odd-footed sign. So we st art from Li, 
go zodiacally and list the rasis aspecting Li. They  are Li, Aq, Ta and Le. The 10 th  
house is in Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. So we start from Sc, go zodiacally and list the 
rasis aspecting Sc. They are Sc, Cp, Ar and Cn. The  11 th  house is in Sg. It is an odd-
footed sign. So we start from Sg, go zodiacally and  list the rasis aspecting Sg. They 
are Sg, Pi, Ge and Vi. So dasas go as 
 
Li, Aq, Ta, Le, Sc, Cp, Ar, Cn, Sg, Pi, Ge, Vi

Lengths of dasas are found as in Narayana dasa. Dasa sequence is given below: 
 
Li: 1 year 
Aq: 9 years 
Ta: 6 years 
Le: 7 years 
 
Leo dasa runs during Jan 1987-Jan 1994. Leo is the 7 
th  from lagna and it contains 
Ketu. It can give spiritual awakening. 
Chart 38 
 
 
Example 83:  Chart 38 shows the rasi chart of Sri Aurobindo Gho se. He was an 
Indian political activist, freedom fighter, yogi, s piritual teacher and a renowned 
author who wrote excellent commentaries on Vedas, Upanishats etc . 
 
After his education in England, he returned to Indi a to take part in India’s freedom 
movement. He was imprisoned by the British in 1908.  During his time in the prison, 
he went through a spiritual evolution. He realized that Indians had lost their 

--- Page 284 ---
  
 
 272 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
independence not only politically, but also cultura lly and religiously 58 . He dedicated 
himself to spreading Indian culture and religion. W hen he was released in 1910, he 
withdrew from active politics and started an aashra m (monastery) in Pondicherry, 
India. During 1906-1913, he was running Scorpio’s d asa as per Drigdasa. Scorpio is 
the 7 th  house from AL; it aspects lagna; and, it contains its lord Ketu. For these 
reasons, Scorpio dasa can bring internal awakening and take one close to liberation. 
AL and the 7 th  from it can also play an important role in externa l activities such as 
renunciation and moving to (or starting) a monastery. 
 
However, his aashram had only a handful of follower s in the beginning. As his 
magazine and books were read by more people, he sta rted becoming popular. In 
early 1920’s, the number of students in his aashram  grew manifold. During 1918-
1925, he ran Cn dasa. As Cn contains lagna, its das a brings true enlightenment and 
also recognition. During lagna’s dasa, a monk can b ecome a chief of a monastery. 
Here he got recognition and his aashram grew. 
 
Libra’s dasa started in August 1925. Sri Aurobindo left the material and spiritual 
charge of his aashram to the Mother and retired int o seclusion to pursue yogic 
sadhana. Libra contains mrityupada and has the arga la of Ketu. No wonder he 
wanted yogic sadhana in seclusion, rather than spre ading religious learning in the 
world. 
 
                                                
 
58  This is partly true even today. It is amazing to s ee how an average Indian intellectual undervalues 
the achievements of Indian culture and the wisdom in the teachings of ancient maharshis.

22.  Niryaana Shoola Dasa 
 
22.1  Introduction 
 
Niryaana means death and shoola is a weapon of Lord  Shiva, who is the lord of 
destruction. Niryaana Shoola dasa is one of the mos t reliable dasa systems for the 
timing of death. Parasara simply called it “Shoola dasa”, but some scholars 
59  use the 
name Shoola dasa to denote a different dasa. We wil l learn it in another chapter. In 
order to avoid confusion, we will call the dasa to be learnt in this chapter as 
“Niryaana Shoola dasa”. 
 
22.2  Computation and Interpretation 
22.2.1  Computation 
 
Find the stronger of the 2 
nd  and 8 th  houses. Start from the rasi containing that house.  
If the rasi is odd, go in the forward (zodiacal) di rection and cover the 12 rasis. If the 
rasi is even, go in the backward (anti-zodiacal) di rection and cover the 12 rasis. 
Dasas of movable, fixed and dual rasis have 7, 8 and 9 years respectively. 60  
 
Classics are not clear about how we go about findin g antardasas. This author 
suggests using the same rules used for Narayana dasa. 
 
22.2.2  Interpretation 
 
Dasa of strong maraka rasis and dasas of rasis cont aining strong maraka grahas can 
bring death. Usually death occurs in the dasa of a Trishoola rasi. There are three 
Trishoola rasis and we can identify the correct ras i based on the longevity category 
(short, middle or long life). 
                                                
 
59  An example is my guru Pundit Sanjay Rath, author o f “Jaimini Maharishi’s Upadesa Sutras” and 
“Crux of Vedic Astrology: Timing of Events”. 
60  Sthira dasa, Mandooka dasa etc  also use the same dasa years, though dasa sequence s are different 
under those dasa systems.

If Trishoolas don’t bring death, the rasi containin g Rudra in the 12 
th  house can bring 
death. 
 
Antardasa at the time of death can be the 6 
th , 7 th , 8 th  or 12 th  rasi from dasa rasi. It can 
also be a rasi that aspects the rasi that, in navam sa, contains the owner of the 8 th  
house from dasa rasi. Suppose dasa rasi at death is  Ta and Jupiter is in Le in 
navamsa. Then the antardasas of the 6 th , 7 th , 8 th  and 12 th  houses from Ta ( i.e.  Li, Sc, 
Sg and Ar) can bring death. Also the antardasas of Ar, Le, Li and Cp – rasis that 
aspect Le, which contains Jupiter in navamsa – can bring death. If there is a common 
rasi between these two principles, it can be a strong candidate. 
 
Example 84: Let us consider the native of Chart 8. Rudra, Tris hoola etc  were found 
for this native in Exercise 23. Let us calculate Niryaana Shoola dasa. 
 
We have to find the stronger of 2 
nd  (Sg) and 8 th  (Ge). Sg is stronger. It is an odd rasi. 
So dasas start from Sg and go as Sg (9 years), Cp ( 7 years), Aq (8 years), Pi (9 
years), Ar (7 years), Ta (8 years), Ge (9 years) etc . It may be seen that Ge dasa starts 
after 9+7+8+9+7+8 = 48 years. It runs till the age of 57 years. The native died at an 
age of 50 years. So he died in Ge dasa. Why? 
 
Well, we found in Exercise 23 that Ge, Li and Aq fo rm Trishoola and the native has 
middle life. Ge is the only Trishoola rasi whose da sa comes in the middle life range 
(36-72 years). 
 
Ge dasa ran during Dec 1994-Dec 2003. When he died in July 1997, the 4 
th  antardasa 
was running (each antardasa is of 9 months). Antardasas in Ge dasa start from Li and 
go as Li, Sc, Sg, Cp etc . The 4 th  antardasa is Cp. It may be noted that Cp is the 8 th  
house from Ge and Cp aspects Le, which contains Sat urns in navamsa. Saturn is the 
8th  lord from dasa rasi. So Ge-Cp antardasa (Ge dasa, Cp antardasa) brought death. 
 
Example 85:  Let us consider Rajiv Gandhi’s chart (see Chart 39 ). He was 
assassinated in May 1991.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 275 
 
 
 
Chart 39 
 
 
The 2 
nd  house is stronger than the 8 th  house, as it is occupied by a planet (Mars). 
Dasas start from Vi. It is an even rasi and so dasa s go backwards. We get Vi dasa of 
9 years, Le dasa of 8 years, Cn dasa of 7 years, Ge  dasa of 9 years, Ta dasa is of 8 
years and Ar dasa of 7 years. Ar dasa ran during Au g 1985-Aug 1992. Mr. Gandhi 
died in this dasa. Why? 
 
Rudra is the stronger of the 8 
th  lords from Le and Aq. So Rudra is the stronger of 
Moon and Saturn (see Table 32). Moon is stronger an d he becomes Rudra. He is in 
Le. So Trishoola spikes are in Ar, Le and Sg. Being a Trishoola rasi, Ar can kill. 
 
In Ar dasa, each antardasa is of 7 months. During M ay 1991, the 10 
th  antardasa was 
running. In Ar dasa, antardasas start from the lord  of the stronger of Ar and Li. Li is 
stronger as its lord Venus aspects it. So dasas sta rt from Le, which contains Venus. 
The 10 th  from Le is Ta. From Ar, the 8 th  lord is Ketu and he is in Cp with Mars in 
navamsa. Ta aspects Cp. 
 

--- Page 288 ---
  
 
 276 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 86: Let us consider India Gandhi’s rasi chart given in  Chart 61 (in a later 
chapter). She was assassinated on October 31, 1984. 
 
Because Saturn is in Cn, we take the 8 
th  houses from Cn and Cp in the normal way, 
instead of using Table 32. The 8 th  lord Rahu is debilitated and he joins another 
planet. The 2 nd  lord Sun also joins another planet. But debilitate d 8 th  lord is a better 
candidate for being Rudra. So Trishoola is in the trines from Sg, i.e.  Ar, Le and Sg. 
 
Because the 2 
nd  house with a planet is stronger than the empty 8 th  house, dasas start 
from the 2 nd  house. As Le is an odd rasi, dasas go zodiacally. Dasas go as Le, Vi, Sc, 
Sg etc . It may be verified that Ar dasa runs during Nov 1 982-Nov 1989. Ar is a 
Trishoola rasi. 
 
Let us find antardasas in Ar dasa. Ar is stronger t han Li, as its lord Mars aspects it. 
Antardasas start from Mars in Le and go as Le, Vi, Le, Sc etc . Each antardasa is of 7 
months as Ar dasa is of 7 years. Nov 1982-June 1983  is the first antardasa of Le. 
June 1983-Jan 1984 is the second antardasaof Vi. Ja n 1984-Aug 1984 is the third 
antardasa of Li. The fourth antardasa of Sc runs du ring Aug 1984-Mar 1985. This is 
the one that brought death. 
 
Sc is the 8 
th  from dasa rasi Ar. So the first antardasa principl e we described is 
correct. Ketu owns the the 8 th  from Ar and he is in Cp in navamsa. Sc aspects Cp and 
the second principle is also satisfied. 
 
Example 87: Let us consider the rasi chart of a male given in Chart 40. He expired 
towards the end of 1949. Antardasa at the time of d eath does not follow the 
principles explained here, but dasa follows the Trishoola principle. Let us verify it. 
 
The 8 
th  lords from Ar and Li are Ketu and Venus. Venus  is  stronger than Ketu. So 
Venus is Rudra. He is in Cp and so Ta, Vi and Cp fo rm Trishoola. Niryaana Shoola 
dasa starts from the stronger of Ta and Sc. Sc is stronger as it has one planet. Sc is an 
even rasi and normally dasas should go as Sc, Li, V i etc . However, Saturn occupies 
Sc and the “Saturn exception” applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp etc . Sc dasa of 8 
years ran during 1927-1935. Sg dasa of 9 years ran during 1935-1944. Cp dasa of 7 
years ran during 1944-1951 and it brought death. As  we have seen, Cp is a Trishoola 
rasi. 

--- Page 289 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 277 
 
 
 
Chart 40 
 
 
Using the principle of three pairs, we get “short l ife” as the result (lagna and 8 
th  lord 
show short life; Moon and Saturn show short life. L agna and HL show long life). 
That is why death came in Cp dasa and not in Ta or Vi dasa. 
 
In fact, this native was a brilliant scholar of man y subjects and also good astrologer. 
He knew that he might have a short life. He was sic k and bed-ridden during his 
college days. He missed most of his classes at coll ege, but he studied on his own and 
appeared at the exams with special permission from his university (there was a 
minimum attendance requirement and he needed a waiver). Despite chronic sickness, 
he graduated with distinction and first rank. He fo und a good job at a young age, but 
chose not to marry till an age of 24. At his time, people in India used to get married 
at a very young age. He thought that he had a praanagandam  (danger to life) and 
decided to stay a bachelor till 24. He did not want  to marry a lady knowing he might 
pass away in a few years. He is an example of the positive use of astrology.

Example 88: Let us consider the rasi chart of a gentleman show n in Chart 41. He 
passed away in 1967. 
Chart 41 
 
 
The 8 
th  lords from Ge and Sg are Saturn and Moon. Saturn i s stronger and becomes 
Rudra. Trishoola is in Ta, Vi and Cp. Shiva’s Trish oola can strike the native (kill the 
native) in one of the three dasas. Let us find dasas now. 
 
The 8 
th  house is stronger than the 2 nd  house and it starts dasas. As Cp is an even rasi, 
dasas normally go as Cp, Sg, Sc etc . Here they go as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc , due to 
Saturn’s presence in Cp. We can see that Vi dasa st arts after 63 years 
(7+8+9+7+8+9+7+8) 61 . So Vi dasa runs during March 1965-March 1974. Bei ng a 
Trishoola rasi, Vi brought death in its Niryaana Shoola dasa. 
 
Exercise 31:  Consider the native whose rasi chart shown in Char t 42. Using the 
method of three pairs, estimate his longevity categ ory. Then identify the dasa of a 
                                                 
61  One thumbrule that can help in calculating Niryaan a Shoola dasa is that the sum of the first 3 dasas 
is always 24 years (7+8+9). The sum of the next 3 d asas is also 24 years.

22.3  Conclusion 
 
Niryaana Shoola dasa is a dasa dedicated to timing one’s death. Niryaana means 
death. In this author’s humble opinion, this dasa i s the best for timing death. Usually 
dasa of one of the three Trishoola rasis brings dea th. However, many special cases, 
exceptions and special rules mentioned by Maharshis  were omited in this book. 
Timing of the antardasa of death wasn’t given due a ttention. Readers should be 
aware that what is taught here is only the tip of an iceberg. Further details are beyond 
the scope of this book. 
 
22.4  Answer to Exercise 
 

--- Page 292 ---
  
 
 280 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Exercise 31: 
 
Lagna lord and 8 
th  lord is Venus. He is in a movable rasi. So we get “long life”. 
Moon and Saturn are in dual and movable rasis. So w e get “short life”. Lagna and 
HL are in movable and fixed rasis. So we get “middl e life”. When there is a three-
way tie, we use the Moon-Saturn pair if Moon is in lagna or 7 th . That is not the case 
here. So we use the lagna and horalagna pair. This gives “middle life” as the 
longevity category (36-72 years). 
 
The 8 
th  lord, Venus, and 8 th  lord from 7 th , Mars, are in Aries. So Rudra is in Aries. 
Trishoola rasis are Ar, Le and Sg. Death can happen in one of the three dasas. 
 
As the 2 
nd  house Sc is stronger due to the aspect of its lord , dasas start from Sc. As 
Sc is even, they go as Sc, Li, Vi, Le etc . Ar dasa starts after 56 years (56=24+24+8; 
24 years for Sc, Li and Vi; 24 years for Le, Cn and  Ge; 8 years for Ta). So Ar dasa 
starts on April 21, 1945 and runs for 7 years. The native is likely to pass away in this 
period. 
 
Antardasa is tough to guess. The 8 
th  lords from Ar are Mars and Ketu. They are in Sc 
in navamsa. The signs aspecting it are Ar, Cn, Sc a nd Cp. Of these, Sc is the 
strongest candidate as it is also the 8 th  from dasa rasi Aries. However, the native died 
in Aries antardasa itself (April 21, 1945-Nov 21, 1 945), due to the strength of Aries 
in rasi chart. Aries not only contains Rudra, but i t is also the 7 th  house and it contains 
2nd , 7 th  and 8 th  lords. It is a strong maraka sthana. 
 
This birthdata belongs to Adolf Hitler. History say s that committed suicide on April 
30, 1945. Russian investigations after World War II supported this.

23.  Shoola Dasa 
 
23.1  Introduction 
 
We looked at “Niryaana Shoola dasa” used for timing  one’s death. There is another 
dasa called Shoola dasa that can also be used for t iming death. It shows death, 
diseases, suffering and death of relatives. 
 
23.2  Computation 
 
Find the stronger of lagna and the 7 
th  house. Dasas start there and always go in the 
regular zodiacal order. For example, if lagna is in  Sc and Ta is stronger than Sc, 
dasas go as Ta, Ge, Cn, Le etc . If lagna is in Le and Aq is stronger than Le, das as go 
as Aq, Pi, Ar, Ta etc . Each dasa is of 9 years. Each dasa is divided int o 12 equal 
antardasas. Antardasas are found using the same rul es as dasas, but treating dasa rasi 
as lagna. If Cn dasa is running and Cn is stronger than Cp, then antardasas go as Cn, 
Le, Vi, Li etc  and each antardasa will last 9 months. 
 
Human beings live in the womb for an average of 9 m onths. For animals with an 
average of gestation period of n months, each dasa and antardasa will be of n years 
and n months respectively. 
 
In mundane astrology, we can use Shoola dasa by com pressing 108 years to the time 
period of effect of the chart. For example, suppose  we want compressed Shoola dasa 
for the swearing-in chart of an Indian Prime Minist er. Then, 108 years of Shoola 
dasa are compressed to 5 years or 60 months (which is the term of an Indian Prime 
Minister) and a dasa of 9 years is compressed 60/12 = 5 months. 
 
23.3  Interpretation 
 
Like in Niryana Shoola dasa, dasa of a Trishoola ra si can bring death. Because the 
2
nd  and 8 th  rasis in the natural zodiac are owned by Mars and Venus, rasi aspect on 

--- Page 294 ---
  
 
 282 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
either of them by Moon generates Rudra yoga and ras is aspected by Rudra yoga 
planets can give death. 
 
This author found the following rules to hold true in many cases: 
 
“AL or the trines from it can give death. If malefi cs or marakas occupy or aspect the 
3
rd  from AL or the 8 th  from AL, those 2 houses can give death.” 
 
Lagna and 7 
th  house both show the self of a person. They stand f or the invisible and 
visible selves. Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from th e 8 th  house from one of them. 
Niryaana Shoola dasa essentially shows the progress  of the 8 th  house. It shows the 
motion of praana (life). That is why it has an uneven motion. It goes forward in some 
charts and backward in some charts. Also the length s of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years. 
All this shows that different people have different  motion of praana. When praana 
reaches Shiva’s Trishoola or a powerful maraka rasi , the native can die. In Shoola 
dasa, however, the motion has a constant rate of 9 years per dasa and the order of 
dasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like th e motion of a quartz crystal. It is 
not  the motion of praana and it must be a universal mo tion. It is suggested that 
Shoola dasas show the force of Lord Shiva. The forc e of Lord Shiva starts from 
one’s self and moves at a constant  rate in a fixed direction. So Shoola dasa rasi 
hitting Trishoola rasis is less significant than Ni ryaana Shoola dasa rasi hitting 
Trishoola rasis. In the case of Shoola dasa, death occurs when Shiva’s motion hits 
AL or the trines from it or the houses of vitality from AL (3 rd  and 8 th ). AL is 
involved instead of lagna, because our existence is  a maya (illusion) and what Lord 
Shiva destroys is the illusion of our existence. Th e physical body (lagna) simply 
merges with the material universe, when burnt or bu ried, and the perceived self or 
the maya  of existence (AL) is what is completely destroyed by Lord Shiva. 
 
Lesson: Niryaana Shoola dasa shows the motion of praana (li fe). Death occurs when 
praana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola rasis). Shoola dasa is 
the reverse. It shows the motion of Shiva. Death oc curs primarily when Shiva’s 
motion hits the trines from AL or the 3 rd  house from AL or the 8 th  house from AL. 
 
We have listed several rasis above. How do we choos e one answer from the list? 
There are 2 criteria: (1) Usually a rasi occupied o r aspected by AK or Jupiter does 
not kill a native, unless that planet happens to be  Rudra. (2) Based on whether the 
native is of short/middle/long life, we are limited  to just 4 dasas. The first 4 Shoola 

--- Page 295 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 283 
 
 
 
dasas (0-36 years) bring death to a person of the short life category. The middle 4 
Shoola dasas (36-72 years) bring death to a person of the middle life category. The 
last 4 Shoola dasas (72-108 years) bring death to a pers on of the long life category. 
We should choose a good candidate from those dasas. 
 
23.4  Examples 
 
Example 89:  Let us revisit Example 84 that we analyzed using N iryaana Shoola 
dasa. 
 
Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Sc. They go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc . Each dasa 
is of 9 years. First 5 dasas are over after 45 year s. The native died in the 50 
th  year. 
From his 45 th  year, the 6 th  dasa was running. So the 6 th  dasa of Ar killed the native. 
One can see that Ar is a trine from AL. It is the only trine in the middle life range. 
 
Example 90:  Let us revisit Example 85 that we analyzed using N iryaana Shoola 
dasa. 
 
Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Le. They go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc . Each dasa is 
of 9 years. First 5 dasas are over after 45 years. The native died in his 47 
th  year. 
From his 45 th  year, the 6 th  dasa was running. So the 6 th  dasa of Cp killed the native. 
One can see that Cp is the only trine from AL in the middle life range. 
 
Example 91:  Let us revisit Example 86 that we analyzed using N iryaana Shoola 
dasa. 
 
The 7 
th  house Cp is stronger and dasas start from Cp. They  go as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc . 
Each dasa is of 9 years. First 7 dasas are over aft er 63 years. The native died in her 
67 th  year. From her 63 rd  year, the 8 th  dasa was running. So the 8 th  dasa of Le killed 
the native. One can see that Le is a trine from AL and it contains the lord of AL. So 
Shiva destroyed the material existence of the native in Cp’s Shoola dasa. 
 
Example 92:  Let us revisit Example 87 that we analyzed using N iryaana Shoola 
dasa. 
 

--- Page 296 ---
  
 
 284 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Ar. They go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc . Each dasa 
is of 9 years. First 2 dasas are over after 18 year s. The native died in the 23 rd  year. 
From his 18 th  year, the 3 rd  dasa was running. So the 3 rd  dasa of Ge killed the native. 
One can see that Ge is the 8 th  house from AL (see Table 32 62 ) and it contains Rahu. 
In other words, Ge is afflicted and it is the house  of longevity of material self. When 
Shiva’s motion hit that rasi, the native died. 
 
Exercise 32:  Consider the native of Chart 43. Using the method of three pairs, 
estimate whether he has short or middle or long lif e. Then evaluate Shoola dasa and 
identify the four dasas in the estimated longevity range. Consider the trines from AL 
and the 3 rd  and 8 th  houses (using Table 32). Think hard and choose the dasa that must 
have given death.

be found from Table 32.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 285 
 
 
 
23.5  Death of Near Relatives 
 
Shoola dasa shows Shiva’s punishment. It shows misf ortune, suffering and death. 
Using it, death of near relatives can also be timed. 
 
For each relative, we treat the house that shows hi m/her as lagna and find Shoola 
dasa based on it. Shoola dasa starts from the stron ger of that rasi and the 7 
th  from it. 
We have different names for Shoola dasas started fr om different houses. For 
example, Pitri Shoola dasa (pitri = father) starts from the stronger of 9 th  and 3 rd  
houses. It is used in the timing of father’s death.  Bhratri Shoola dasa (bhratri = 
brother) also starts from the stronger of 3 rd  and 9 th  houses and it shows the death of 
younger siblings. Matri Shoola dasa (matri = mother ) starts from the stronger of 4 th  
and 10 th  houses. Dara Shoola dasa (dara = wife) starts from  the stronger of 7 th  and 1 st  
houses and it shows the death of wife (this dasa wi ll be identical to the native’s 
normal Shoola dasa). Putra Shoola dasa (putra = son ) starts from the stronger of 5 th  
and 11 th  houses and it shows the death of a child. 
 
We mentioned earlier that sthira karakas are useful  in timing death. Sthira karaka of 
father represents father in a chart, for the purpos e of matters controlled by Shiva ( i.e.  
suffering and death). Pitri Shoola dasa shows the m otion of Shiva’s force for the 
father. When Shiva’s force strikes trines from sthi ra karaka of father, father’s death 
can take place. Trines from the corresponding arudha pada can also give death. 
 
Similarly, we can time the death of other near rela tives. Let us see a couple of 
examples. 
 
Example 93: Let us consider the native of Chart 44. His father  passed away in the 
second half of 1995. 
 
Exalted Sun joins Mercury and Jupiter aspects him. So Sun is stronger than Venus. 
He becomes sthira pitri karaka (fixed significator of father). Death can occur in trines 
from him, i.e.  Ar, Le and Sg. Pitri pada (A9, arudha pada of 9 
th  house) is in Sg. 
Trines from it are the same. 
 
The 9 
th  house is in Aq. Among Aq and Le, Aq is stronger as  its lord Rahu is in a rasi 
with a different oddity. Dasas go as Aq, Pi, Ar etc . 

--- Page 298 ---
  
 
 286 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Dasa of Aq runs during 1971-1980. Dasa of Pi runs d uring 1980-1989. Dasa of Ar 
runs during 1989-1998. Death occurred in this dasa.  As already noted, Ar contains 
sthira karaka of father and it is a trine from A9. 
 
Chart 44 
 
 
Example 94: Let us consider Indira Gandhi’s birthdata given in  Chart 61 (in a later 
chapter). Her father Jawaharlal Nehru died in May 1 964. Her husband Feroze 
Gandhi died in 1960. Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 1980. 
 
Sthira karaka of father is Venus here, as he is in a dual rasi. He shows father, for the 
purpose of matters ruled by Shiva. Death of father can occur in the trines from 
Venus, i.e.  Sg, Ar and Le. Pitri Shoola dasa starts from Pi (9
th  house) and goes as Pi, 
Ar, Ta, Ge etc . Le dasa starts after 5 dasas, i.e.  in 1917 + 45 = 1962. It runs till 1971. 
Her father died in 1964 in this dasa. 
 
Jupiter is sthira karaka of husband. He shows husba nd, for the purpose of matters 
ruled by Shiva. Death of husband can occur in trine s from Jupiter. Dara Shoola dasa 

--- Page 299 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 287 
 
 
 
starts from Cp and goes as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc . Jupiter is in Ta and Ta dasa runs from 
1917 + 36 = 1953. It ends in 1962. Her husband died in 1960 in this dasa. 
 
Jupiter is also sthira karaka of children. He shows  children, for the purpose of 
matters ruled by Shiva. Death of son can occur in t rines from Jupiter. Putra Shoola 
dasa starts from Sc (5 
th  house and stronger than Ta) and goes as Sc, Sg, Cp , Aq etc . 
Jupiter is in Ta and Ta dasa runs from 1917 + 54 = 1971. It ends in November 1980. 
Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 1980. He died in Ta dasa. 
 
Exercise 33:  Consider the rasi chart of a lady born in 1950, gi ven in Chart 45. 
Compute Shoola dasa and identify the dasas that can  give death to her husband. 
Looking at the 3 rd  from sthira karaka for husband, guess whether the death was 
violent or peaceful.

 288 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Method of three pairs : (1) Lagna lord and 8 th  lord is Venus and he is in dual rasi. 
Dual + Dual gives middle life. (2) Moon is in a fix ed rasi and Saturn is in a dual rasi. 
Fixed + Dual gives long life. (3) Lagna and HL are in movable rasis. Movable + 
Movable gives long life. So the final result is “lo ng life”. This range covers 72-108 
years. So the last 4 Shoola dasas can bring death. 
 
Shoola dasa : The 7 
th  house Aries is stronger as it has the aspect of Su n, Mercury and 
its lord Mars. Dasas start from Ar and go as Ar, Ta , Ge, Cn etc . The first 8 dasas are 
over after 72 years (8 x 9). The 9 th  dasa of Sg runs during 72-81 years of age. The 
10 th  dasa of Cp runs during 81-90 years of age. The 11 th  dasa of Aq runs during 90-
99 years of age. The 12 th  dasa of Pi runs during 99-108 years of age. These are the 
four dasas in the long life range. 
 
Death when : Arudha lagna is in Aq. The trines are Aq, Ge and Li. The only trine in 
the long life range, i.e.  among the 4 rasis mentioned above, is Aq. Its dasa  can give 
death. However, it contains Jupiter who is also AK. So its dasa is unlikely to kill. We 
can try the 8 
th  house from AL. From Table 32, we find that Cp is t he 8 th  house from 
Aq. It is afflicted by Rahu here (just as in Example 92). So it is a good candidate. 
 
Final Answer : This chart belongs to Frank Sinatra, a legendary singer and actor of 
US. He died of a heart attack on May 14, 1998. He d ied in his 83 
rd  year. Shoola dasa 
of Cp was running then. 
 
Exercise 33: 
 
Shoola dasa starts from Sg and goes thus – Sg: 1950 -1959, Cp: 1959-1968, Aq: 
1968-1977, Pi: 1977-1986, Ar: 1986-1995, Ta: 1995-2 004, Ge: 2004-2013. Sthira 
karaka of husband is Jupiter and he is in Cp. So de ath can occur in Cp, Ta and Vi. Of 
these, Cp dasa comes too early. Most likely candidate is Ta dasa (1995-2004). 
 
Sthira karaka for husband is Jupiter. The 3 
rd  from him is Pi, occupied by Moon and 
Rahu. Mars also aspects it. So the death is likely to be violent. 
 
Husband of this lady passed away in a road accident in 2000.

24.  Kalachakra Dasa 
 
24.1  Introduction 
 
Sage Parasara said in his classic “Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram”: 
 
 
 
It means, “there is another dasa called Kalachakra dasa, which is the most 
respectable of all dasa systems”. Kalachakra litera lly means “the wheel of Time”. It 
shows how the wheel of time unfolds events in the life of an individual. Parasara said 
that Lord Shiva explained this dasa to Goddess Parvati. 
 
24.2  Computation 
 
Nakshatras are divided into two groups – Savya (zod iacal) group and Apasavya 
(anti-zodiacal group), as shown in Table 42. Note that the first 3 nakshatras belong to 
the savya group, the next 3 constellations to the apasavya group and so on. 
 
Table 42: Nakshatra Classification 
Savya Group

Parasara taught that we can draw Kalachakra (wheel of Time) by drawing 2 sets of 
12 houses for savya and apasavya groups of nakshatr as, then repeating them and 

--- Page 302 ---
  
 
 290 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
distributing them between nakshatras. Savya means “ zodiacal” and apasavya means 
“anti-zodiacal”. 
 
We write the 12 rasis in one set (either zodiacally or anti-zodiacally). In the other set, 
we write their mirror images, i.e.  the other sign owned by the same planet. The 
mirror image of Ar is Sc. The mirror image of Ta is  Li. The mirror image of Cp is 
Aq. However, the mirror image of Cn is Cn itself an d that of Le is Le itself, as they 
are the only signs owned by their lords. The main s equence and the mirrored 
sequence together form a sequence of 24 rasis . We have two such sequences – one 
for the savya group and the other for the apasavya group (see Table 43). We find 
antardasas and dasas by repeating these 24-rasi sequences and going through them. 
Table 43: Parasara's Kalachakra Basis 
Savya Group 
Main Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Mirrored Sc Li Vi Cn Le Ge Ta Ar Pi Aq Cp Sg 
Apasavya Group 
Mirrored Sg Cp Aq Pi Ar Ta Ge Le Cn Vi Li Sc 
Main Pi Aq Cp Sg Sc Li Vi Le Cn Ge Ta Ar 
 
The first  pada (quarter) of Aswini is associated with the first  9 rasis in the savya 
group above (Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg). T he dasa running at birth will be 
one of these 9 rasis and one will run dasas of 9 ra sis starting from that rasi. One born 
with Moon at the beginning of the first pada of Aswini will run Ar dasa at bir th and 
run Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc and Sg dasas after i t. One born with Moon in the 
middle of the first pada of Awini may run Le dasa at birth  and run Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, 
Aq, Pi and Sc dasas after it. One born with Moon to wards the end  of the first pada of 
Aswini may run Sg dasa at birth and Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc,  Li, Vi, Cn and Le dasas after it. 
Based on the elapsed fraction of the 1 
st  pada of Aswini, we choose the initial dasa 
from the 9 rasis associated with that nakshatra pad a and then proceed along 
Kalachakra and list 9 rasis starting from it. The second pada of Aswini is associated 
with the next 9 rasis in the savya group above (Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge). 
 
Like this, as we go from one nakshatra pada (conste llation quarter) to the next in the 
savya group, we move from one set of 9 rasis to the  next. When we reach the end of 
the 24 rasis, we go to the beginning. In this manne r, we can find a set of 9 rasis 

--- Page 303 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 291 
 
 
 
associated with each nakshatra pada. The first of t he nine rasis is called “Deha rasi” 
(body sign) and the last one is called “Jeeva rasi” (spirit/life sign). 
 
At the end of the 4 
th  quarter of Aswini, the 1 st  quarter of Bharani starts and we do the 
same thing. We go to the next 9 rasis in the set of 24 rasis. 
 
We can do the same thing in the case of apasavya na kshatras and use the 24-rasi 
sequence given for the apasavya group in Table 43. In the case of apasavya 
nakshatras, the first rasi in the nine rasis corres ponding to a nakshatra pada is called 
“Jeeva rasi” and the last one is called “Deha rasi”  (note that the definition has 
reversed). 
 
For the sake of those who do not understand the abo ve logic well enough to list the 
nine rasis associated with each nakshatra pada, the y are explicitly given in Table 44-
Table 47. For the purpose of these tables, we will divide savya and apasavya groups 
of nakshatras into two sub-groups each.

It may be noted in the tables above that there is a column called “paramaayush”. This 
gives the sum of the dasas of the nine rasis associ ated with the constellation quarter. 
We now need to define the durations of various dasa s. The duration of a dasa is 
based in its owner, as shown in Table 48. Two rasis  owned by the same planet have 
the same duration. 
Table 48: Dasa Years in Kalachakra Dasa

Saturn Cp & Aq 4 
 
Let us go through the procedure used in finding dasas and antardasas, in case it is not 
yet obvious to the reader: 
 
(1)  Find the nakshatra pada occupied by natal Moon. Ide ntify the 9-rasi sequence 
associated with it, using Table 44-Table 47. Also, note down the paramayush. 

--- Page 305 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 293 
 
 
 
(2)  Find the fraction of the nakshatra pada that was covered by Moon at birth. 
(3)  Find the same fraction of the paramayush. That repr esents the portion of the 
paramayush (dasas of the nine rasis) that was over before birth. Based on this, we 
can find which of the nine dasas runs at birth and how much of the dasa remains 
at birth. 
(4)  After this dasa, we go to the next rasi in the nine  rasis. When we finish the nine 
rasis of the nakshatra pada, we go to the nine rasi s of the next nakshatra pada. 
After the nine rasis of the 4 
th  pada of a nakshatra, we go to the nine rasis 
corresponding to the 1 st  pada of the next nakshatra ( i.e.  1 st  pada of the 
constellations belonging to the other sub-group  in the same group ). For example, 
after the nine rasis of the 4 th  pada of Savya-1 constellations, we go to the nine 
rasis of the 1 st  pada of Savya-2 constellations. After the nine ras is of the 4 th  pada 
of Apasavya-2 constellations, we go to the nine rasis of the 1 st  pada of Apasavya-
1 constellations. 
(5)  In each dasa, antardasas start from dasa rasi itself. After the first antardasa, we go 
to the next rasi. After that, we go to the next ras i. And so on. We take 9 rasis 
starting from  dasa rasi and antardasas will belong to those rasi s. We distribute 
the dasa length among the 9 antardasas proportional ly (in proportion to their 
respective dasa lengths as given in Table 48). If we reach the end of the nine rasis 
corresponding to the nakshatra pada when counting 9  rasis from dasa rasi, we 
proceed to the next nakshatra pada as described in rule (4) above. 
 
All this may seem complicated to a casual reader, b ut it must be obvious to anyone 
who clearly understood Kalachakra shown in Table 43  and followed how Table 44-
Table 47 are derived from it. A couple of examples may make this clearer. 
 
Example 95:  Suppose Moon is at 15Ta50 in someone’s natal chart . Let us find 
Kalachakra dasa for him. 
 
Moon is in Rohini 2 
nd  pada, which runs from 13Ta20 to 16Ta40. From Table  46, we 
find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatr a pada are: Vi, Li, Sc, Pi, Aq, Cp, 
Sg, Sc, Li. 
 
Table 49: Calculation for Example 95 
 Vi Li Sc Pi Aq Cp Sg Sc Li 
Years 9 16 7 10 4 4 10 7 16

 294 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Cumulative 9 25 32 42 46 50 60 67 83 
 
The amount of the nakshatra pada traversed by Moon is 15º50' – 13º20' = 2º30'. The 
fraction of the nakshatra pada 
63  traversed by Moon is (2º30')/(3º20') = 150'/200' =  
0.75. The same fraction of paramayush (83 years) is  0.75 x 83 = 62.25 years. So 
62.25 years out of the 83 years were over before bi rth. We see from Table 49 that 60 
years were over by the end of Sg dasa and 2.25 year s of Sc dasa added to it makes it 
62.25 years. So Sc dasa was running at birth and 7 – 2.25 = 4.75 years of Sc dasa 
were remaining at birth. By adding 4 years 9 months  to the birthdate, we get the date 
on which Sc dasa ends. Then Li dasa of 16 years wil l run till an age of 20 years 9 
months. With Li dasa, we finish the nine rasis asso ciated with the 2 nd  pada of Rohini 
(Apasavya-1). So we go to the 3 rd  pada in the same table. The next 7 dasas 64  will be 
Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg. Their lengths are as given in Table 48.65  
 
Example 96:  Suppose Moon is at 3Cn00 in someone’s natal chart.  Let us find 
Kalachakra dasa for him. 
 
Moon is in Punarvasu 4 
th  pada, which runs from 0Cn00 to 3Cn20. From Table 4 4, 
we find that the 9 rasis associated with this naksh atra pada are: Cn, Le, Vi,  Li, Sc, 
Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. 
 
Table 50: Calculation for Example 96 
 Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Years 21 5 9 16 7 10 4 4 10 
Cumulative 21 26 35 51 58 68 72 76 86 
 
The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (3º0' )/( 3º20') = 180'/200' = 0.9. The 
same fraction of paramayush (86 years) is 0.9 
x 86 = 77.4 years. So 77.4 out of the 
86 years were over before birth. We see from Table 50 that 76 years were over by 
the end of Aq dasa and 1.4 years of Pi dasa added t o it makes it 77.4 years. So Pi 
dasa was running at birth and 10 – 1.4 = 8.6 years of Pi dasa were remaining at birth. 
                                                 
63  The complete length of each nakshatra pada is 3º20 '. 
64  Parasara suggested taking the dasas of nine rasis starting from the rasi whose dasa is running at 
birth. Sc dasa was running at birth and Sc and Li d asas belong to the set of nine rasis associated wit h 
Rohini 2 nd  pada. We already have 2 rasis. So we just need 7 r asis from the next pada. 
65  We again have the issue of solar years vs savana y ears. This author prefers savana years with all 
nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa is a nakshatra dasa. 

--- Page 307 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 295 
 
 
 
By adding 8 years 7 months 6 days to the birthdate,  we get the date on which Pi dasa 
ends. With Pi dasa, we finish the nine rasis associ ated with the 4 
th  pada of Punarvasu 
(Savya-1). So we go to the 1 st  pada of Savya-2 nakshatras (Table 45). The next 8 
dasas will be Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar. Their lengths are as given in Table 48. 
 
Exercise 34:  Suppose Moon is at 5Aq50 in someone’s natal chart.  Let us find 
Kalachakra dasa for him. 
 
Example 97: Let us find the antardasa sequences in the 1 
st , 2 nd , 3 rd  and 4 th  dasas in 
Example 95. 
 
The 1 
st  dasa is Sc (from the 2 nd  pada of Apasavya-1 constellations). We should star t 
from Sc and find 9 rasis. After Sc, we have Li and the 9 rasis corresponding to the 
2nd  pada end there (see Table 46). So the next 7 rasis should be taken from the 9 rasis 
corresponding to the next pada, i.e.  3 rd  pada. So we get antardasas in Sc dasa as Sc, 
Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg. 66  
 
Similarly, one can see that antardasas in Li dasa ( 2 
nd  dasa) go as Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, 
Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp. Antardasas in Vi dasa (3 rd  dasa) go as Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, 
Aq. Antardasas in Le dasa (4 th  dasa) go as Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. 
 
One can notice that dasa sequences and antardasa se quences all come from the two 
24-rasi sequences given in Kalachakra (see Table 43 ). In the cases of dasas, the 
starting point in the 24-rasi sequence is determine d by the nakshatra pada of Moon 
and the portion elapsed in it. In the case of antar dasas, the starting point is based on 
dasa rasi. 
 
To learn how the lengths of antardasas are computed , let us take Le dasa as an 
example. We found that antardasas in Le dasa are Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. 
By adding the dasa lengths of these 9 rasis (see Ta ble 48), we get 86 years. So we 
divide Le dasa of 5 years into 86 parts and give 5 parts to Le antardasa, 21 parts to 
Cn antardasa, 9 parts to Ge antardasa and so on. 
 
                                                
 
66  However, we see from Example 95 that 2.25 years of  Sc dasa were over before birth. So some of 
these antardasas may be over before birth.

24.3  Interpretation 
 
24.3.1  Basics 
 
Dasa of a rasi gives the natural results of the ras i. For example, dasa of Pisces may 
give saattwik religious activities. Dasa of Aries m ay give enterprise or quarrels or 
wounds. 
 
More importantly, dasa of a rasi gives the results of the house and planets in that rasi. 
If Aries has the 5 
th  house in D-7, its dasa may give children. If Pisce s has the 8 th  
house in D-6, its dasa may give diseases. If Gemini  has lagna in D-24, its dasa may 
give all-round progress in the accumulation of know ledge. If Sc has AL in D-10 and 
its lord Mars occupies it, its dasa may bring good developments related to career and 
status. Dasa of a rasi containing the 8 th  from AL in D-10 may give a fall in status at 
workplace. Dasa of a rasi may also give the results  of its lord. If Mars is in the 5 th  
house in D-7, Aries dasa may give children. 
 
Samudaaya Ashtakavarga (SAV) plays an important rol e in deciding the results in a 
dasa. If a rasi has too many or too few rekhas in S AV of a particular divisional chart, 
then its dasa may bring favorable or unfavorable re sults, respectively, relating to the 
significations of that house in that divisional cha rt. Usually dasas of rasis with 30 or 
more rekhas in D-10 SAV bring the best phases in on e’s career and dasas of rasis 
with 30 or more rekhas in in D-24 SAV bring the bes t periods for learning. One 
should keep SAV of various divisional charts with o ne when interpreting Kalachakra 
dasa. 
 
24.3.2  Deha and Jeeva Rasis 
 
In Table 44-Table 47, we listed the deha and jeeva rasis of different nakshatra padas. 
However, these hold for one born at the beginning o f the nakshatra pada. One can 
have different deha and jeeva rasis based on the el apsed portion in the nakshatra 
pada. 
 
Deha and jeeva rasis are simply the rasis of the first  and the ninth dasas in the case 
of one born in a savya  nakshatra. In the case of one born in an apasavya nakshatra, 
deha and jeeva rasis are the rasis of the ninth and the first dasas. 

--- Page 309 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 297 
 
 
 
 
In Example 95, the first dasa is Sc and the ninth d asa is Sg. Since Rohini is an 
apasavya nakshatra, Sc becomes jeeva rasi and Sg be comes deha rasi. In Example 
96, the first dasa is Pi and the ninth dasa is Ar. Since Punarvasu is a savya nakshatra, 
Pi becomes deha rasi and Ar becomes jeeva rasi. 
 
Deha rasi shows body and jeeva rasi shows the spiri t. Benefics and malefics 
transiting in them affect them positively and negat ively (respectively). If Jupiter, 
Mercury and Venus are transiting in one’s jeeva ras i, one may exhibit a positive 
spirit and be cheerful. If Mars, Sun, Saturn and Ra hu are transiting in one’s jeeva 
rasi, one may be without any enthusiasm. If Mars, S un, Saturn and Rahu are 
transiting in one’s deha rasi, one may face accidents or death. 
 
24.3.3  Gatis (special movements) 
 
We see that dasas progress in a regular fashion in Kalachakra dasa. We either go as 
Ar, Ta, Ge etc  or as Pi, Aq, Cp etc . However, some irregularities can be found. The 
rasis whose dasas come after an irregular leap go b y special names and special 
results are attributed to those dasas in classics. 
 
(1)  A trinal leap (from Sg to Ar or vice versa; from Pi  to Sc or vice versa) is called 
“Simhaavalokana gati”  (lion’s leap) 
67 . 
(2)  Temporary reversal of the direction is called “Markati gati”  (monkey’s leap). 
When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc  in savya nakshatras, we 
temporarily reverse the direction when we go from C n to Le. So Le is a markati 
gati rasi. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le,  Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc  in apasavya 
nakshatras, we temporarily reverse the direction wh en we go from Le to Cn. So 
Cn is a markati gati rasi. 
(3)  Leaving one rasi and jumping over it is called “Mandooki gati”  (frog’s leap). 
When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc  in savya nakshatras, we have 2 
jumps – ( i) from Vi to Cn and ( ii ) Le to Ge. So Cn and Ge are mandooki gati 
rasis. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le, Cn,  Vi, Li, Sc etc  in apasavya 
nakshatras, we have 2 jumps – ( i) from Ge to Le and ( ii ) Cn to Vi. So Le and Vi 
are mandooki gati rasis. 
                                                 
67  Simhavalokana doesn’t really mean a lion. It stric tly means a lion’s view of the jungle from an 
elevated vantage point. 

--- Page 310 ---

The results attributed to various leaps are given in Table 51. 
Table 51: Results of gatis (leaps)

Distress to wife, loss of children, 
fever, sickness and loss of position 
 
In addition, Parasara listed the directions to pref er and the directions avoid, while 
travelling and relocating, during different leaps. 
 
(1)  In the leap from Vi to Cn, east will give great res ults. One can take up an 
auspicious journey in the northern direction. 
(2)  In the leap from Le to Ge, east should be avoided. A journey to the southwest 
will be fruitful. 
(3)  In the leap from Cn to Le, a move in the southern d irection results in losses. 
West is favorable. 
(4)  In the leap from Pi to Sc and in the normal movemen t from Sg to Cp, there will 
be troubles in the northern direction. 
(5)  In the leap from Sg to Ar, journeys should be avoid ed, as they may result in 
sickness, imprisonment or death. 
(6)  In the normal movement from Sg to Sc, journeys will  bring comforts, wealth and 
sexual pleasures.

24.4  Practical Examples 
 
Example 98: The navamsa chart of a male who got married in Dec  1994 is shown in 
Chart 46. 
 
Readers can verify that the native had about 5 year s of Sc dasa left at birth and the 
next dasas are Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn. At t he time of wedding, the native was 
running Pi-Pi (Pi dasa & Pi antardasa). Why did Pisces give marriage? 
 
Well, it has lagna in navamsa and its lord Jupiter is in the 7 
th  house! Naturally Pi and 
Vi are the front-runners for giving marriage. Moreo ver, Pi is the 2 nd  from Venus. 
Venus symbolizes domestic happiness and marital bli ss. The 2 nd  from him in 
navamsa can show the sense of family happiness. It can show a new person coming 
into the family. 
 
In addition, one may note that exalted Venus occupi es Pi in rasi chart and he owns 
darapada, which is in Libra. So Pisces is conducive  to physical relationship and 
marital pleasures. 
 
Venus is in Aq in navamsa. While rasi shows what ex ists at the physical level, 
navamsa shows the inner self and the sense of conne ctedness. So Aq dasa can 
activate Venusian influence at navamsa level and gi ve some romance. During Aq 
dasa (1990-1994), this native had a love affair wit h the lady he was to marry in 
December 1994.

Example 99:  The D-24 shown in Chart 47 belongs to an astrologe r. He learnt 
astrology at a young age, but he has been seriously  into astrology since 1993. In 
particular, 1996-2000 was a very fruitful period. K nowledge came to him like rain 
from monsoon clouds. He never felt as fulfilled as he did with the knowledge that 
came to him in 1996-2000. 
 
One may note that about 3 years and 2 months of Sg dasa was left at birth and Ar, 
Ta, Ge, Cn etc  dasas run after it. One may find that Gemini dasa of 9 years started in 
1996. This dasa brought fine knowledge and intellectual satisfaction. Why? 
 
Gemini contains lagna in D-24. Lagna stands for all -round progress. This is D-24 
and lagna in it shows all-round progress related to  learning and knowledge. Its lord 
Mercury is in the 5 
th  house of scholarship from lagna. So this dasa can increase 
scholarship. Mercury and Venus are in trines from G e and they contribute to the 
prosperity of the indications of Ge. Moreover, Ge i s very strong in D-24 with 34 
rekhas in SAV. Any rasi 30 or more rekhas brings fa vorable results related to that 
house in that divisional chart.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 301 
 
 
 
Chart 47 
 
 
The strongest houses in this D-24 SAV are Le (36 re khas), Ge (34 rekhas) and Pi (33 
rekhas). They are the 7 
th , 5 th  and 2 nd  houses from AL. As these are the houses 
conducive to recognition and awards, this D-24 show s a person with academic 
achievements and associated recognition. With Ge be ing the 5 th  house from AL and 
also A5, this dasa can bring some reputation for hi s knowledge. So this dasa brings 
knowledge, scholarship and also recognition for it. 
 
Example 100:  Let us consider the native whose D-12 is given in Chart 48. father 
passed away in 1967. 
 
We can see that about 1 year and 8 months of Pi das a was remaining at birth and the 
dasas coming after it are Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, T a and Ar. Cn dasa started in 
September 1966 and Cn-Cn antardasa was running at the time of his father’s demise. 
 

--- Page 314 ---
  
 
 302 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Chart 48 
 
 
Lagna in D-12 is in Vi. The 9 
th  house is in Ta. The 9 th  house in D-12 shows the 
relation with father and the associated happiness. It stands for the “concept” of father 
and paternal guidance. The “physical body” of the f ather is an illusion related to the 
concept of father and A9 represents it. So we can u se the 9 th  lord or A9 to see the 
physical body of father. Here A9 is in Cp. Taking C p as lagna, we see that Cn is the 
7th  house of death and its lord Moon is exalted. Moon is not only exalted, but he 
afflicts Sun, who owns the 8 th  house from Cp. So Cn-Cn antardasa can result in th e 
death of father. Moreover, Cn dasa here comes after  Vi and involves mandooki gati 
(frog’s leap). We see from the previous discussions  that mandooki gati in savya 
nakshatras can bring distress to father. 
 
Exercise 35: The native of Example 100 lost his mother in Li-Li antardasa. Why? 
 
Example 101: Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s birthdata and D-10 chart is gi ven in Chart 3. He 
has been India’s Prime Minister since March 1998. 
 

--- Page 315 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 303 
 
 
 
About 4.5 years of Vi dasa was left at birth. The d asas to follow are Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, 
Ar, Sg, Cp and Aq. His 4-year Cp dasa runs during 1998-2002. 
 
We can see that Cp has 31 rekhas in the SAV of D-10  and 34 rekhas in the SAV of 
rasi chart. Because Cp is strong in both charts, Cp dasa must be good. 
 
The houses having 30 or more rekhas are the 1 
st , 3 rd , 5 th , 7 th  and 10 th  houses from AL. 
Most of these houses are important for fame and rec ognition (and AL is the most 
appropriate reference for judging fame and recognit ion). The strength of these 
houses in D-10 SAV means that the native has a successful and famous career. Being 
the 5 th  house from AL, Cp can bring reputation and power. Moreover, the lord of Cp 
is exalted in GL. In addition, Cp contains A5 in ra si chart and D-10. A5 shows the 
illusion associated with the 5 th  house matters. In D-24, A5 shows the illusion 
associated with scholarship (5 th  house), i.e.  one’s degrees, academic distinctions and 
awards. In D-10, it shows the illusion associated with one’s following (5 th  house), i.e.  
the positions held and the power wielded by one. Fo r this reason, the presence of A5 
in Cp adds to the probability of power in Cp dasa. 
 
Example 102:  Let us revisit Example 82. Chart 49 gives the D-20  chart of the 
devotee whose rasi chart was considered in that example. 
 
Ta dasa of about 9.5 years was left at birth. The d asas to follow are Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp, 
Sg, Ar, Ta and Ge. Pi dasa started in July 1987 and  Sg antardasa in it was running 
when he moved to the monastery. 
 
Pi and Sg are owned by Jupiter and they can give re ligious knowledge. Pi is the 12 
th  
house in D-20 and Sg is the 9 th  house. The 12 th  house in D-20 shows spiritual 
evolution and activities related to moksha. It has 33 rekhas in SAV and hence it is 
strong. So its dasa can take in the direction of li beration from material bonds and 
evolution of soul. 
 

--- Page 316 ---
  
 
 304 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Chart 49 
 
 
The antardasa sign Sg is the 9 
th  house from lagna. The 9 th  house shows guidance. In 
D-20, it shows one’s spiritual guru or organized re ligion or religious practices. It can 
also show pilgrimages. It can certainly show moving  to a monastery. Darapada (A7) 
of D-20 is in Sg. The 7 th  house shows relations with others. Its arudha pada  shows 
the illusion associated with relationships or the t hings based on which the world 
forms an impression about one’s relationship with o thers. It shows the people one 
associates with. Darapada in D-20 shows the people one associates with, in one’s 
spiritual life. So antardasa of the rasi containing  darapada in D-20 can bring him to 
the people he will associate with for the rest of h is religious life. With Sg containing 
Sun, natural significator of soul, and the nodes, h is soul went through a churning 
during Sg antardasa and he wandered in forests thin king about what life is. But Sg is 
also the 9 th  house and its antardasa brought him to a monastery before its end. 
 
The next antardasa belonged to Ar, which contains l agna. So there was all-round 
progress in spiritual matters. Ar has 33 rekhas in D-20 SAV and it is strong. In 
addition, Ar contains A5 (mantra pada, arudha pada of the 5 
th  house) and this 
antardasa may have brought some religious initiatio n and practice of some mantras. 
It should be noted that the 5 th  house in D-20 shows one’s devotion and bhakti  in 

--- Page 317 ---
 
 
 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 305 
 
 
 
religious matters. A5 shows the maya relating to de votion, i.e.  practice of mantras 
and religious rituals. 
 
One may note that the 3 
rd  house (Ge) and A3 (Li) have 30 or more rekhas in t he 
SAV. The 3 rd  house shows one’s communication skills. In D-20, i t shows 
communication skills as applicable in religious act ivities. A3 shows the associated 
illusion, i.e.  the things based on which the world forms impressi ons about one’s 
communication skills. It can show the books and art icles authored by one. In D-20, it 
shows one’s religious works. If one casts D-10 of t his native, one will see that the 3 rd  
house and A3 have 30 or more rekhas, in D-10 SAV al so. Houses with 30 or more 
rekhas in SAV are strengthened as per Parasara. So the 3 rd  house and A3 are strong 
in both D-20 and D-10. One can conclude that this n ative will be a good 
communicator and will be known for some religious l iterature. In fact, he is already 
authoring a translation of “Sreemadbhaagavatam” int o his mother tongue and travels 
with some ISKCON gurus as an interpreter. A lot of worthy religious literature and 
translations will emerge from the pen of this blessed soul in the years to come. 
 
Exercise 36:  The lady whose rasi and navamsa charts are given i n Chart 50 was 
married in Sg dasa and divorced in the same dasa. S g contains Venus, the 
significator of marriage. However, Venus also owns the 2 nd  and 7 th  from upapada in 
rasi and navamsa. This dasa brought her marriage as  well as divorce. Guess the 
antardasa that may have brought the marriage and th e antardasa that may have 
brought the divorce.

24.5  Conclusion 
 
Kalachakra dasa was called “the most respectable da sa of all dasas” by Parasara. 
There are many controversies regarding its computat ion. This book follows the 
approach that this author found the most acceptable  based on his study of “Brihat 
Parasara Hora Sastram” and his practical researches . A significant percentage of this 
author’s successful long-range life-phase predictio ns were made using Kalachakra 
dasa 
68  and that is his favorite dasa. 
                                                 
68  And, a significant percentage his successful short -term predictions (focussing on a period of one or 
two weeks) were made using Tajaka annual and monthl y charts.

 308 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
When we learn a new dasa, the first question we sho uld ask is “when should it be 
applied and what results should be seen in it”. It is illogical to use 10 different dasas 
interchangably. Mixing up various dasas without kno wing the subtle differences 
between them results in vague explanations. An intelligent astrologer will realize that 
different dasas are good at showing different kinds  of events. Even when different 
dasas show the same event, they show it from differ ent angles and focus on 
different aspects of the same event.  Without appreciating this, one cannot 
understand why maharshis described tens, if not hundreds, of dasa systems. 
 
Hence it is important to learn when a dasa can be a pplied and what kind of results it 
shows. Some authors suggested that Kalachakra dasa applies only when Moon is 
stronger in navamsa chart than in rasi chart. Howev er, this author opines that 
Kalachakra dasa is applicable to all people, as Par asara did not impose any 
conditions on its applicability and went to the ext ent of calling it “the most 
respectable dasa”. 
 
Vimsottari dasa is based on the nakshatra of Moon. It throws light on the state of the 
native’s mind as time progresses. It focusses on mi nd. Narayana dasa shows the 
progress of lagna in one’s life and it shows the di rection taken by one’s life. The 
focus is no longer on mind, but it is on the real h appenings. Of course, one’s mental 
state directly depends on the direction taken by on e’s life and the real happenings in 
one’s life. In that sense, Vimsottari dasa and Nara yana dasa show the same events. 
But the focus is different. 
 
Kalachakra dasa depends on Moon’s navamsa. Navamsa shows one’s adherence of 
dharma or duty and throws light on the inner self. So the focus in Kalachakra dasa is 
state of the inner self and the sense of connectedn ess in one’s mind. It shows how 
connected one is with respect to the events in one’s life. Fo r example, a political 
leader may be running D-10 Narayana dasa of a yogak araka rasi and he may land 
political power. He may be running the Vimsottari d asa of Sun who may be exalted 
in D-10 and so he may be feeling powerful. However,  if Kalachakra dasa of a weak 
and afflicted house in D-10 runs at the same time, his inner self may not feel 
connected with the events in his career and he may feel a void. On the other hand, if 
Kalachakra dasa rasi is strong and occupied by bene fics in D-10, then one may be 
successfully involved in activities that keep his inner self engaged.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 309 
 
 
 
Narayana dasa specializes in showing what happens i n one’s life; Vimsottari dasa 
specializes in showing how one’s mind views what happens in one’s life; and, 
Kalachakra dasa specializes in showing how one relates to  what happens in one’s 
life and how connected one feels. These three are t he most important of all general 
purpose phalita dasas. 
 
Different dasas do not provide different alternatives that can be used interchangeably  
to understand what happens in one’s life, but they provide different angles – or 
vantage points – to view the same kaleidoscope that life is. 
 
24.6  Answers to Exercises 
 
Exercise 34: 
 
Moon at 5Aq50 is in Dhanishtha 4 
th  pada, which runs from 3Aq20 to 6Aq40. From 
Table 47, we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: Sg, Sc, Li, 
Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar. 
 
Table 52: Calculation for Exercise 34 
 Sg Sc Li Vi Le Cn Ge Ta Ar 
Years 10 7 16 9 5 21 9 16 7 
Cumulative 10 17 33 42 47 68 77 93 100 
 
The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (2º30 ')/( 3º20') = 150'/200' = 0.75. The 
same fraction of paramayush (100 years) is 0.75 
x 100 = 75 years. So 75 years out of 
the 100 years were over before birth. We see from T able 52 that 68 years were over 
by the end of Cn dasa and 7 years of Ge dasa added to it makes it 75 years. So Ge 
dasa was running at birth and 9 – 7 = 2 years of Ge  dasa were remaining at birth. By 
adding 2 years to the birthdate, we get the date on  which Ge dasa ends. Then we run 
16 years of Ta dasa and 7 years of Ar dasa. With Ar  dasa, we finish the nine rasis 
associated with the 4 th  pada of Dhanishtha (Apasavya-2). So we go to the 1 st  pada of 
Apasavya-1 nakshatras (Table 46). The next 7 dasas will be Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar, Ta, 
Ge. So we get the following calculations: 
 
Ge dasa (02 years): 00-02 years of age 
Ta dasa (16 years): 02-18 years of age 

--- Page 322 ---
  
 
 310 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Ar dasa (07 years): 18-25 years of age 
Sg dasa (10 years): 25-35 years of age 
Cp dasa (04 years): 35-39 years of age 
Aq dasa (04 years): 39-43 years of age 
Pi dasa (10 years): 43-53 years of age 
Ar dasa (07 years): 53-60 years of age 
Ta dasa (16 years): 60-76 years of age 
Ge dasa (09 years): 76-85 years of age 
 
Exercise 35: 
 
The 4 
th  house is in Sg. A4 or the arudha pada of 4 th  house is in Vi. From Vi, Li is the 
2nd  house. Its lord Venus is in exalted in the 7 th  house and afflicts the debilitated 1 st  
lord (all from Vi). So Li is a strong maraka rasi f rom Vi. So Li-Li antardasa resulted 
in the death of mother. 
 
Exercise 36: 
 
Let us take navamsa. Ge contains A7 in navamsa and can show a relationship. It 
contains the 3 
rd  from UL (upapada lagna) and can show the start of a marriage. It is 
the 7 th  house from Venus. It is the 4 th  house of harmony and bliss from lagna. Its lord 
Mercury is exalted in the 7 th  house. Ge has 33 rekhas in SAV. For all these reas ons, 
Ge can be the antardasa. The 7 th house Vi is also a candidate, but it is very weak with 
only 22 rekhas in SAV. 
 
For divorce, the 6 
th  and 8 th  houses from lagna and the 2 nd  and 7 th  houses from UL are 
good candidates. The 6 th  and 8 th  houses from lagna bring marital troubles and 
quarrels. The 2 nd  and 7 th  houses from upapada bring the end of marriage. Her e Li is 
the 8 th  house from lagna and the 7 th  house from upapada. It is the 7 th  house from 
upapada in rasi also. In navamsa, it has 30 rekhas in SAV. While the 7 th  house has 
only 22 rekhas, the 8 th  house has 30 rekhas and so the 8 th  house is strong. Evil 
houses, when strong, only bring evil results. 
 
Final Answer : The lady got married in Ge antardasa in Feb 1992 and got divorced in 
Li antardasa in late 1995. 
 
Exercise 37: 
 
Ta dasa of about 13 years was left at birth. Then G e dasa of 9 years, Le dasa 5 years 
and Cn dasa of 21 years followed. Cn dasa ran during 1964-1984.

 Part 2: Dasa Analysis 311 
 
 
 
 
Cn is the 10 
th  from lagna. Its lord Moon is in the 5 th  from lagna. Moreover, Cn 
contains AL and shows status in career. Its strengt h is decided by SAV. SAV of D-
10 is shown below: 
 
         Ar Ta Ge Cn  Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi  
Rekhas   24 28 21 38  34 21 26 26 37 31 25 26  
 
In SAV, Cn has 38 rekhas. That is exceedingly stron g. With the rasi containing AL 
having 38 rekhas in SAV, the status of this actor m ust be high. He must be a well-
known actor. And, Cn dasa must’ve brought excellent  results and increased his 
stature as an actor. 
 
Final Answer : This chart belongs to Bill Cosby, one of the most  gifted entertainers 
that the US television industry has ever seen. He h ad a successful acting career in 
films too. He came to limelight in 1965 with a ligh thearted adventure TV serial 
called “I Spy”. He was the first black American to star in a prime-time television 
drama series in US, and for his performances on the  show he won the Emmy Award 
for best actor in 1966, 1967, and 1968. The onset of Cn dasa brought him status.

Part 3:  Transit Analysis 
 
 
 
The constant movement of planets in the skies is wh at is meant 
by the word “transits” in astrology. Planets keep m oving. The 
relationship between (1) the positions of planets a t a given time 
and (2) the positions of planets at a person’s birt htime, will 
have a major impact on the kind of results that pla nets can give 
the person at the time. 
 
Position of planets at any given time can be found out from 
computer programs/software or ephemeris or almanacs  
(panchangas). Judging the results for a person base d on those, 
given the natal (birth) chart, is the subject of this part. 
 
There are many special techniques in Vedic astrolog y for 
interpreting transits. Some of those techniques are  explained in 
this part. 

--- Page 326 ---
  
 
 314 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
25.  Transits and Natal References 
 
25.1  Introduction 
 
By transits or gochaara, we mean the motion of planets in the skies. By the transit or 
chaara or gochaara position of a planet, we mean th e position occupied by a planet at 
a given time. By the natal or radical or birth or janma position of a planet, we mean 
the position occupied by a planet at the time of one’s birth. 
 
By correlating the transit positions on a given day  with the natal positions of several 
reference points, we can draw some conclusions abou t the nature of results 
experienced by the native then. Some methods normal ly employed in such 
correlation will be studied in this chapter. 
 
25.2  Transits from Moon 
 
The most popular natal reference in transit analysis is Moon. Moon is the significator 
of mind and analysis of planetary positions with re spect to Moon shows the mental 
state. Depending on the houses occupied by transit planets with respect to natal 
Moon, they exert different influences on one’s mental state. The transit of Vimsottari 
dasa lord is particularly important, because he is the one who has the greatest 
influence on one’s mental state during a period. 
 
The rasi occupied by Moon in the natal chart is cal led “ janma rasi ” and planets give 
different results when transiting in different hous es from janma rasi. The standard 
results given in literature are given in Table 53 – Table 59. 
 
These results are given only for reference. In real ity, not everyone with the same 
janma rasi experiences the same results on a given day (or week or month). The 
results given by planets depend on what they stand for in the natal chart. For 
example, if Mars is the 5 
th  lord in a natal chart, then the worries given by h im during 
his transit in the 8 th  house from janma rasi may pertain to children. If Mars is the 10 th  
lord in natal chart, then the worries given by him during his transit in the 8 th  house 
from janma rasi may pertain to career.

 Part 3: Transit Analysis 319  
 
Example 103: Suppose someone has Moon in Ge in natal chart. Let  us analyze the 
transits on June 7, 1999. The transit chart is shown in Chart 52. 
 
Janma rasi is Ge. Transit Jupiter and Saturn are in Ar, the 11 
th  house from janma rasi. 
This is a good transit and shows gains. The native may have gains in the matters 
signified by the houses ruled and occupied by Jupit er and Saturn in natal rasi chart 
and natal divisional charts. Because Jupiter signif ies children and tradition and 
Saturn signifies livelihood, the gains may also be related to children, traditional 
cermemonies, livelihood etc . 
 
Transit Sun is in Ta, the 12 
th  house from janma rasi. That gives expenditure and 
losses. One may have losses in the matters signifie d by the houses ruled and 
occupied by Sun. Because Sun signifies authorities and health, it may also be related 
to those. 
 
Mercury is in janma rasi (Ge). This suggests “quarr els, imprisonment, losses, poor 
advice”. However, Mercury is strong being in own ho use (intellectual Gemini). So 
the results may be intellectual debates and arguments. 
 
In this manner, we can analyze transits of all the planets. We can use the results 
given in literature, but we should adapt them intel ligently to the chart at hand. We 
should understand what each planet stands for in a chart. 
 
In addition, there are natal references other than Moon, though Moon is the most 
important natal reference when interpreting transits. 
 
25.3  Other Natal References 
 
We can analyze transits with respect to lagna and p aaka lagna. Lagna is the hub of 
vitality and one’s personality in a chart. Using th e ashtakavarga tables, we can 
decipher whether the transit of a planet in a house  from lagna is favorable or not. We 
can see which house a planet is transiting in, with  respect to natal lagna, and expect 
the planet to influence the matters of that house. The influence exerted by a transit 
planet on the house occupied by it depends on its i nherent nature and its 
significations in the natal chart. For example, Jup iter transiting in the Ta may give 
marriage to someone born in Sc lagna, because Ta is  the 7 
th  house from Sc. Saturn 

--- Page 332 ---
  
 
 320 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
transiting in Ar may give relationship problems or marital problems for someone 
born in Li lagna, because Ar is the 7 th  house from Li. 
 
We can also look at the aspects cast by transiting planets. Suppose Jupiter is 
transiting in Vi and someone has lagna in Sc. Jupit er aspects Ta, the 7 
th  house from 
Sc, when he is in Vi. So Jupiter can give marriage during his Vi transit also. We can 
look at the aspects cast by transiting planets on t he rasis containing the natal houses 
and the natal planets. Suppose someone has lagna in  Sc and Venus in Pi in natal 
chart. Then the 7 th  house is in Ta and Venus, the significator of marr iage, is in Pi. 
Jupiter transiting in Vi aspects both Ta and Pi and hence he may give marriage. 
 
Thus we should look at the rasis occupied and aspec ted by planets in their transit and 
find out which houses and planets occupy those rasi s in the natal chart. Based on 
that, we should guess the results given by the plan ets. A planet occupying or 
aspecting a rasi in transit influences  the matters signified by the houses and 
planets stationed in that rasi in the natal chart. The exact nature of the influence 
exerted by a planet depends on its inherent nature and the matters it stands for in the 
natal chart. For example, if the 5 
th  lord in the natal chart is occupying the 8 th  house 
from natal lagna in transit, some troubles related to children may be expected. If 
Mars is the 8 th  lord in the natal chart and aspects, in transit, t he rasis occupied by 
Venus and 7 th  lord in the natal chart, then some disturbances in  marital life may be 
expected. 
 
Sahams are useful in transit analysis. Sahams are t he significant points in the zodiac. 
For example, when the 7 
th  lord or Venus transits close to vivaha saham, one may get 
married. When the 6 th  lord or 8 th  lord or Mars or Rahu transits close to kali saham,  
one may have an accident. 
 
A malefic planet transiting in janma rasi may give mental worries and a malefic 
planet transiting in natal lagna may affect the vit ality of the native and create 
obstacles in his efforts. On the other hand, paaka lagna explicitly stands for the 
physical self and a malefic planet transiting in pa aka lagna may give bodily 
complaints. Similarly planets occupying or aspectin g arudha padas in transit may 
give relevant results. For example, Saturn’s transi t in A10 can be bad for career, 
Jupiter’s transit in A9 is good for fortune and so on. 
 
Example 104: Let us consider the natal chart of a lady and the transit chart at the 
time of her wedding (see Chart 53).

 Part 3: Transit Analysis 321  
 
 
Chart 53 
 
 
The 7 
th  house in the natal chart is in Vi. Mercury is the 7 th  lord and he is in Cn in 
natal chart. Venus is the significator of marriage and he is in Le in the natal chart. 

--- Page 334 ---
  
 
 322 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Vivaha saham is at 1º in Cp in the natal chart. If important planets influence these 
reference points in transit, they can give marriage. 
 
Jupiter is a natural benefic and also lagna lord he re. His transit is important for 
timing auspicious events. On the day of wedding, Ju piter occupied Pi, aspecting Vi 
(natal 7 
th  house) and Cn (has natal 7 th  lord). Natal 7 th  lord Mercury occupied Cp in 
transit and aspected Cn, rasi occupied by him in th e natal chart. In addition, transit 
Mercury was stationed about 1º away from natal viva ha saham. Venus also aspected 
his natal position in transit. 
 
25.4  Transits and Divisional Charts 
 
Though the motivation  for the approach described here comes from some pr inciples 
described in classics, the actual approach is essen tially based on this author’s own 
researches. This author heard about “Bhrigu transits” , which correlate the transit 
positions in navamsa chart with the natal positions  in rasi chart. However, he does 
not know much about the tradition of Bhrigu transit s to conclude whether or not his 
findings are loosely related to that tradition. 
 
Though this author prefers to teach only those appr oaches that have the sanction of 
maharshis, he finds this particular approach superi or to most other techniques of 
transit analysis. Moreover, this approach does not violate any teachings of 
maharshis. This is also a fertile area for research  and deserves our attention. Hence it 
will be covered here. However, readers are advised to keep in mind that what follows 
is a product of the very limited intelligence of th is author and hence prone to errors. 
Readers are encouraged to question and to conduct further researches in this area. 
 
We said that a planet occupying or aspecting a rasi  in transit influences the matters 
signified by the houses and planets stationed in th at rasi in the natal chart. For 
example, we said that Jupiter transiting over Venus
69  may give marriage. However, 
we know that navamsa is the chart that shows marria ge. So, is there any significance 
for Jupiter’s rasi chart transit over the navamsa of Venus? In other words, if Venus is 
in Cancer in navamsa, can Jupiter transiting in Cancer in rasi chart bring marriage? 
 
                                                
 
69  We say that “Jupiter transits over Venus”, if Jupi ter, in his transit, occupies the rasi occupied by 
Venus in the natal chart. 

--- Page 335 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 323  
 
We do not have different zodiacs for different divi sional charts. All the divisional 
charts use the same zodiac. So Cancer in natal nava msa chart and Cancer in transit 
rasi chart are not different. They are one and the same. If Jupiter transiting in Cancer 
can influence the house and planets stationed in Ca ncer in rasi chart, he should be 
able to influence the house and planets stationed i n Cancer in navamsa chart too! We 
can extend this logic to all the divisional charts. 
 
Rasi chart shows everything that exists at the phys ical level. Divisional charts show 
various areas of life. The interaction between the two decides how events in various 
areas of life materialize at the physical level. Na tal chart shows the innate potential. 
Transit chart shows the temporary influences. The i nteraction between the two 
decides how temporary influences convert innate pot ential into actions and life 
events. 
 
So the most important interactions are those between 
 
(1)  a natal divisional chart and the transit rasi chart, and, 
(2)  the natal rasi chart and a transit divisional chart. 
 
Here (1) shows how innate potential in a particular  area of life is influenced at a 
given time to result in action at the physical leve l. This helps us in coarse timing of 
events. We can fine-tune the timing of events with (2), which shows how the 
potential at the physical level is transformed into an event in a particular area of life. 
 
Example 105: Let us consider the natal navamsa chart of a male engineer and the 
transit rasi chart at the time of his wedding (see Chart 54). 
 
In natal navamsa, Pi contains the 7 
th  house and its lord Jupiter is in Aq. When we 
look at navamsa, we should look at the 9 th  lord. The 9 th  lord in navamsa shows the 
dharma followed. In Hindu life, the marriage ceremo ny is an act of dharma. Here 
Venus shows dharma. So Venusian influence over the 7 th  house shows getting 
married. In the transit rasi chart of wedding, Venu s occupies Aq, which is 7 th  lord 
Jupiter’s natal navamsa position.

 Part 3: Transit Analysis 325  
 
Jupiter is in own sign in Pi in transit, which is t he 7 th  house in natal navamsa. Moon 
owns the 11 th  house in natal navamsa and he shows gains in the m atters of dharma 
and marriage. He is in Aries in the transit Rasi ch art and Aries contains upapada in 
the natal navamsa chart. This shows the fructificat ion, at the physical level, of gains 
in dharma due to marriage. Lagna lord Mercury is in  Cp in the natal navamsa, 
showing dharmik self. In transit rasi chart also, Mercury occupies the same house. 
 
The key points will be summarized again: 
 
(1)  Jupiter is in Pi in transit rasi chart and aspects Vi. Lagna is in Vi and the 7 
th  
house is in Pi in the natal navamsa chart. 
(2)  Venus is the significator of marriage and the lord of the 9 th  house (dharma) in 
natal navamsa. He is in Aq in the transit rasi char t. The 7 th  lord Jupiter occupies 
Aq in the natal navamsa chart. 
(3)  Mercury is the lord of lagna and occupies Cp, in the natal navamsa chart. He is in 
Cp in the transit rasi chart also. 
 
Example 106: Let us consider the natal D-7 chart of a gentleman  and the transit rasi 
chart at the time of the birth of his daughter (see Chart 55). 
 
D-7 shows children and happiness from them. The 5 
th  house shows children. It is Vi 
here. Jupiter, the significator of children, and ex alted Mercury occupy it. It may be 
noticed that both Jupiter and Mercury are in Vi at the time of child-birth. So 5 th  lord 
in D-7 and significator of children activated the 5 th  house of D-7 in their rasi chart 
transit and that gave a child. 
 
Example 107:  Let us consider the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Natal D-11 and 
transit rasi charts are given in Chart 56. Natal ra si chart and transit D-11 charts are 
given in Chart 57. 
 
D-11 or Rudramsa is the chart that shows death and destruction. Considering that the 
native had a violent death in a plane crash, D-11 is the apt chart to see his death. 
 
In rasi chart, the 3 
rd  house from AL shows the place and nature of death. It must have 
the aspect of a cruel planet for a violent death. Here the 3 rd  house from AL is in Cp, a 
watery sign. It is aspected by Rahu from Le and a violent death in water is possible.

Chart 57 
 
 

--- Page 341 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 329  
 
Now, we must analyze D-11 carefully for a violent death. Natal D-11 has lagna in Ge 
and Rahu occupies it. That is consistent with a vio lent death. The 2 nd  house in Cn is 
strong with its lord Moon occupying it. Sun is the 3 rd  lord – which shows physical 
vitality – and he joins the house of death, 7 th , with 7 th  lord Jupiter. Mercury owns 
lagna and he is in 12 th . This D-11 chart has unfavorable features. Now let  us look at 
the houses occupied in transit rasi chart, with res pect to this D-11, by the planets of 
life – Mercury (1 st  lord), Sun (3 rd  lord) and Saturn (8 th  lord) – and the planets of 
death – Jupiter (7 th  lord) and Moon (2 nd  lord) and Rahu (a malefic in lagna). 
 
Two planets of life, Mercury and Sun, are in Cn, af flicted by Rahu. Cn is the 2 
nd  
house and stands for death in the natal D-11. Plane t of death Moon is in Le (a house 
of life from natal D-11 lagna) and Jupiter aspects him, as well as his own 7 th  house 
(Sg). Saturn is debilitated. On the whole, the hous es and planets of life in D-11 are 
afflicted or weak in the transit rasi chart. 
 
Now let us look at the interaction between the nata l rasi chart and the transit D-11 
(Chart 57). In rasi chart, Le is lagna and Sun is l agna lord. Le represents the native, 
Cp represents his accidents, Sun represents the physical body and Aq (7 
th ) and Saturn 
(7 th  lord) represent death. Jupiter (8 th  lord) represents longevity. 
 
The natal rasi chart shows the existence of the native at the physical level. The transit 
D-11 represents the momentary forces of destruction  and let us study its interaction 
with the natal rasi chart. 
 
In transit D-11, Le is afflicted by Rahu and 12 
th  lord Moon. Jupiter, who represents 
longevity is in the 12 th  house. Sun, who represents the physical body in th e natal rasi 
chart, is in the 6 th  house of accidents in transit D-11 with exalted Ma rs, significator 
of accidents. The 7 th  lord in natal rasi chart, Saturn, represents the e nd of the native’s 
life and he is in Sc in transit D-11, the same sign  that contains lagna lord in the natal 
rasi chart. So the killer of the natal rasi chart ( Saturn) interacts with the physical 
body (Sun) in the chart showing momentary forces of destruction (transit D-11). 
 
Exercise 38: For a native born on 4 
th  April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at Machilipatnam, 
India (81e12, 16n15), an important event related to  D-4 happened on 16 th  August 
1991. Try to guess it based on the interaction betw een natal D-4 and transit rasi 
chart. Then analyze the interaction between natal rasi chart and transit D-4 also.

 330 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Exercise 39 : The native of Exercise 38 had an important event related to D-24 on 
April 17, 1998. Try to guess it based on the intera ction between the natal D-24 chart 
and the transit rasi chart. 
 
25.5  Transits and Ashtakavarga 
 
Though one of the purposes of ashtakavarga is to as sess the strength of planets and 
houses in natal charts, its most important purpose is the interpretation of transits. Just 
as we look at the house occupied by a transit plane t with respect to natal Moon and 
natal lagna, we can look at the houses occupied by a transit planet with respect to all 
the eight references used in ashtakavarga. 
 
If a planet is benefic in its transit rasi with res pect to 5 or more natal references, out 
of eight, then it will produce good results. If a p lanet is benefic in its transit rasi with 
respect to 3 or less natal references, out of eight , then it will produce bad results. Of 
course, the exact nature of the good or bad results  given by a planet depend on its 
natural significations and its significations in the natal chart. 
 
To see this, we look at the number of rekhas in the  transit rasi in the transiting 
planet’s BAV. If, for example, Saturn’s BAV of the natal rasi chart has 5 rekhas in 
Ta, then that means that Saturn is benefic with res pect to 5 out of 8 natal references 
in Ta. So he produces good results when he transits  Taurus. The same logic can be 
extended to the divisional charts. If Jupiter has 8  rekhas in Ar in natal D-10 chart, 
then his transit in Aries in rasi chart invariably brings excellent results in career. The 
matters that benefit depend on Jupiter’s placement and ownership in the natal D-10 
chart. Basically, Jupiter’s rasi transit in Aries a ctivates the manifestation of Jovian 
energy at the physical level in Aries. If Jupiter h as many rekhas in his D-10 BAV, it 
shows that Jovian energy in Aries goes well with most sources of energy in D-10 and 
thus it can have a significant impact on a native’s career. 
 
A planet with 6 or 7 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV invariably brings excellent 
results. A planet with 1 or 0 rekhas in its transit  rasi in its BAV invariably brings 
very poor results. 
 
25.5.1  Samudaaya Ashtakavarga 
 

--- Page 343 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 331  
 
In addition to looking at the transit planet’s nata l BAV, we should also look at the 
natal SAV – Samudaaya Ashtakavarga. If, for example , SAV has 40 bindus in 
Pisces, then it means that Pisces is very strong in  the chart. Planets transiting in 
Pisces, tend to give good results irrespective of t heir strength. Of course, if a planet 
with 6 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV and a planet wit h 2 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV 
are transiting Pi, the former planet will produce b etter results than the latter planet. 
Rekhas in the individual BAVs of planets also matte r, but SAV will dominate over 
the BAVs if it has too many or too few rekhas. 
 
Planets transiting in rasis with more than 30 rekha s in SAV usually bring favorable 
results. Planets transiting in rasis with less than  25 rekhas in SAV usually bring 
unfavorable results. 
Chart 58 
 
 
Example 108: Let us consider the D-10 chart of Sri A.B. Vajpaye e, India’s Prime 
Minister (see Chart 58). His D-10 ashtakavarga is given below:

SAV     23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30 
 
He became India’s Prime Minister on March 19, 1998 (see Chart 59). 
Chart 59 
 
 
Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn are all in Pi and Pi has 30 rekhas in SAV. None of 
them is too weak in individual BAV. Venus is GL lor d in natal D-10 and he is an 
important planet for power and authority. In the tr ansit chart, he is in Cp. Cp has 31 
rekhas and Venus has 6 rekhas. Moon is in Sc with 3 5 rekhas. Jupiter is in Aq. 
Though Aq is not strong in SAV, it is strong in Jup iter’s BAV. It has 7 rekhas in 
Jupiter’s natal D-10 BAV. Jupiter’s strength is imp ortant, as he is the Vimsottari 
dasa lord. 
 

--- Page 345 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 333  
 
So 6 out of 7 planets are in rasis that are very strong in D-10 SAV. And the 7 th  planet 
is extremely strong in its BAV. Vimsottari dasa lor d and natal GL lord have 7 and 6 
rekhas respectively. 
 
So, as per ashtakavarga, transits are very favorabl e to Sri Vajpayee’s career on 
March 19, 1998. 
 
Exercise 40: Consider the D-10 chart of a gentleman and the tra nsit rasi chart during 
a crucial week in his life, given in Chart 60. What  are the prospects for his career at 
the time of the transit? Do you expect good results or setbacks? 
 
25.5.2  Kakshyas and Prastaara Ashtakavarga 
 
Each rasi is divided into eight kakshyas of 3º 45' each. Kakshya literally means 
“orbit”. When a planet is in Saturn’s kakshya, its placement with respect to Saturn is 
the most important. When a planet is in Jupiter’s k akshya, its placement with respect 
to Jupiter is the most important. The first kakshya  in each rasi starts from 0º in that 
rasi and ends at 3º 45'. Saturn is the ruler of the  first kakshya. The start and end 
points and the lords of all the eight kakshyas are given in Table 60. 
 
Table 60: Kakshyas 
Start End Kakshya lord

26º 15' 30º Lagna 
 

--- Page 346 ---

Chart 60 
 
 
Example 109: Let us say Mercury is at 16º in Cn, Jupiter is it 24º in Vi and Venus is 
at 4º in Sc. Because 16º is between 15º and 18º 45' , Mercury is in the kakshya of 

--- Page 347 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 335  
 
Venus. Because 24º is between 22º 30' and 26º 15', Jupiter is in the kakshya of 
Moon. Because 4º is between 3º 45' and 7º 30', Venus is in the kakshya of Jupiter. 
 
In the above example, Venus is in the kakshya of Ju piter and hence the placement of 
Venus with respect to Jupiter is more important tha n his placement with respect to 
other planets. Suppose the BAV of Venus has 5 rekha s in Sc. Then Venus is benefic 
in Sc with respect to 5 out of 8 references and tha t is favorable. However, when 
Venus is at 4º in Sc, he is in Jupiter’s kakshya an d what matters the most is whether 
Venus is benefic in Sc with respect to Jupiter or n ot. If Jupiter is not one of the 5 
references from which Venus is benefic in Sc, then Venusian transit between 3º 45' 
and 7º 30' in Sc will not be favorable. 
 
To find out whether Venus is benefic with respect t o Jupiter in Sc or not, we can 
look at the Prastaara Ashtakavarga (PAV) of Venus. If we find that Venus is benefic 
with respect to Jupiter in Sc, we say that the PAV of Venus has a rekha in the 
kakshya of Jupiter in Sc. Each rasi has eight kaksh yas and a kakshya has a rekha in a 
planet’s PAV if that planet is benefic in that rasi with respect to the kakshya lord.  
 
A popular method of delineating favorable and unfav orable days is to look at the 
number of planets that are in a kakshya with a rekh a. If too many or too few planets 
are in a kakshya with a rekha, favorable or unfavor able results may be expected 
(respectively). However, one should not use this pr inciple in vacuum. It should be 
used only in conjunction with dasas, Tajaka charts and other transit analysis 
techniques. This principle can only be used to fine-tune a prediction to a few days. 
 
Example 110:  Let us consider Indira Gandhi’s assassination. Her  chart and the 
transit chart at the time of her assassination is given in Chart 61. 
 
Sun is at 14 Li 24. Because 14º 24' is between 11º 15' and 15º, he is in his own 
kakshya. Sun’s PAV does not have a rekha in Sun’s k akshya in Li. Sun is benefic in 
Li only with respect to lagna, Moon, Mercury, Jupit er and Saturn. So only the 
corresponding kakshyas in Li have a rekha in Sun’s BAV. 
 
It can be seen that Sun is in Sun’s kakshya, Moon i n Sun’s kakshya, Mars in Moon’s  
kakshya, Mercury in lagna’s kakshya, Jupiter in Ven us’s kakshya, Venus in 
Mercury’s kakshya and Saturn in Moon’s kakshya. Onl y Moon and Mercury are in 
kakshyas with rekhas.

With 5 out of 7 planets transiting in kakshyas with out rekhas, including Vimsottari 
dasa lord Saturn, it is not a favorable time for Mrs. Gandhi. 
 
Again it must be emphasized that this technique can only be used in conjunction with 
other techniques and readers should not rush to pre dictions just based on this 
principle. 
 
25.6  Timing with Sodhya Pindas 
 
Parasara taught some techniques of timing events ba sed on sodhya pindas. We can 
take the number of rekhas in any  house from a planet and multiply the count with th e 
planet’s sodhya pinda. We can get a nakshatra from that product by dividing it with 
27, taking the remainder and counting nakshatras fr om Aswini. Benefics and 
malefics transiting in the nakshatra will give good  or bad results (respectively) 
relating to the original house. Especially Saturn’s transit is important. Saturn’s transit 
in the nakshatra corresponding to a particular hous e makes the signified matters 
suffer. Jupiter’s transit is beneficial. Some peopl e also take the 10 
th  or 19 th  nakshatra 
from the nakshtra found above. A nakshatra and the 10 th  and 19 th  nakshatras from it 
are owned by the same planet under Vimsottari dasa scheme and they go together. 
 
We can also find a rasi by dividing the product wit h 12 instead of 27 and counting 
rasis from Aries. Saturn’s transit in the resultant rasi brings misfortune relating to the 
original house. However, nakshatras are more important. 
 
When we find houses from Sun , we should look at matters related to soul, inhere nt 
nature, personality, will power and father. Houses from Moon  show mind, wisdom, 
peace, happiness and mother. Houses from Mars  show siblings, land and strength. 
Houses from Mercury  stress on business, commerce, profession, friends and good 
behavior. Houses from Jupiter  show the nourishment of body, learning, children and 
wealth. Houses from Venus  show marriage, comforts, luxuries, vehicles and se xual 
pleasures. Saturn  shows longevity, livelihood, fears, sadness, dangers and sorrows. 
 
When we want to time events relating to a particula r matter, we should first fix the 
relevant planet. Then we should fix the relevant ho use. We should then find the 
number of rekhas in that house from that planet in that planet’s BAV. We should 
multiply it by the sodhya pinda of the planet (also  called yoga pinda). By dividing 
the product with 27 or 12 and taking the remainder,  we should find the associated 

--- Page 350 ---
  
 
 338 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
nakshatra or rasi. Then we can time key events base d on the transits in that nakshatra 
and rasi. 
 
For example, suppose we want to time the good and b ad periods of a native’s father. 
Father should be seen from Sun and the 9 
th  house. We can take Sun’s BAV and find 
the number of rekhas in the 9 th  house from Sun. Suppose Sun is in Aq. Suppose 
Sun’s BAV contains 5 rekhas in Li (the 9 th  from Aq). Suppose Sun’s sodhya pinda is 
86. Multiplying 86 with 5, we get 430. If we divide  430 by 27, the quotient is 15 and 
the remainder is 25. The 25 th  constellation is Poorvabhadrapada. So Saturn’s tra nsit 
in Poorvabhadrapada is bad for father and Jupiter’s  transit in the same nakshatra is 
good. Now let us find the rasi. By dividing 430 by 12, we get a quotient of 35 and a 
remainder of 10. So Saturn’s transit in Cp (the 10 th  rasi of the zodiac) is bad for 
father and Jupiter’s transit in Cp is good. 
 
Though Parasara indicated that we can take any hous e from any planet and gave a 
long list of matters to be seen from each planet, h e gave a few specific examples. A 
list of the matters is given in Table 61. 
 
Table 61: Timing with Sodhya Pinda 
Planet House Area of life 
Sun 9 th  Father 
Moon 4 th  Mother 
Mars 3 rd  Siblings 
Mercury 10 th  Profession 
Jupiter 5 th  Children 
Venus 7 th  Marriage 
Saturn 8 th  Longevity 
 
Some examples will be given now. However, this appr oach does not give consistent 
results. Readers should realize that the topic of s odhya pindas is open to research. 
Most astrologers use these principles with only the  rasi chart. If matters relating to 
father have to be seen from D-12, as taught by Para sara, should we use D-12 when 
timing events related to father? Should we use the sodhya pinda and rekha count 
from D-12? Should we take the 9 
th  from Sun in rasi chart or take it in D-12? All 
these are issues that need to be researched. Moreov er, as we have learnt, there are 
some inconsistencies between Parasara and Varahamih ira in the definition of 
ashtakavarga and this can alter the sodhya pindas o f Moon and Venus. In addition, 

--- Page 351 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 339  
 
we have some controversies in the exact definitions  of the reductions to be done to 
get Sodhita Ashtakavarga from Bhinna Ashtakavarga. That can again alter sodhya 
pindas. Timing of events with sodhya pindas is a ve ry important topic, but what the 
readers learn here may not be the final word. It is  hoped that readers will experiment 
with an open mind and share their findings with other astrologers. 
 
Example 111: Let us consider Princess Diana, who died in a fata l automobile crash 
when Saturn was in Revathi star (Pisces). Her rasi chart is given in Chart 62. 
Chart 62 
 
 
To see longevity, we should use the 8 
th  house from Saturn and Saturn’s BAV. The 8 th  
house from Saturn is Le.

Saturn’s BAV    3  4  6  3  0  2  2  5  4  3  2  5 
 

--- Page 352 ---
  
 
 340 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Le has 0 rekhas in Saturn’s BAV. Saturn’s sodhya pi nda is 203. The product is 0. By 
dividing it with 27, we get 0 which is equivalent t o 27. So we get Revathi star. By 
dividing 0 with 12, we get 0 which is equivalent to 12. So we get Pisces. 
 
When Saturn was transiting in Revathi star in Pisces, she passed away. 
 
Example 112: Let us look at the rasi chart of software tycoon B ill Gates (see Chart 
24). Despite Jupiter’s simultaneous transit, Saturn ’s transit in Krittika star brought 
some troubles. In a landmark ruling in June 2000, a  US judge ruled that his company 
– software giant Microsoft Corporation – was a mono poly and ordered a breakup 
into two smaller companies. 
 
Moon’s BAV is shown below: 
 
             Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Moon’s BAV    4  3  4  4  6  3  1  5  5  4  4  6 
 
Moon is in Pisces and Pisces has 6 rekhas. Moon’s s odhya pinda is 122. The product 
of 122 and 6 is 732. By dividing 732 with 27, we ge t a quotient of 27 and a 
remainder of 3. The 3 
rd  star is Krittika (26 Ar 40 – 10 Ta 00). So Saturn’ s transit in 
Krittika star can attack the 1 st  house from Moon – the mental state and happiness. 
 
Saturn shows sorrows, suffering and fears. The 6 
th  house shows litigation. The 6 th  
from Saturn can be used for sorrows and setbacks in  litigation. Saturn’s BAV is 
shown below: 
 
               Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Saturn’s BAV    3  3  4  4  7  2  1  3  2  4  3  3 
 
Here the 6 
th  house from Saturn is Pi and it has 3 rekhas in Sat urn’s BAV. Saturn’s 
sodhya pinda is 145. The product of 145 and 3 is 43 5. By dividing 435 with 27, we 
get a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 3. That aga in shows Krittika star. So Saturn’s 
transit in Krittika star can bring sadness and setbacks related to litigation. 
 
As a result, he suffered an unfavorable ruling from a US judge.

25.7  Conclusion 
 
Transit positions of planets are the positions occu pied by them at a given time. Natal 
positions of planets are the positions occupied by them at the time of one’s birth. 
Natal positions stand for the innate potential of a  nativity and the transit positions 
show the temporary influences – planetary pulls and  pushes. If their interaction is 
studied, some insight can be gained on the kind of results that are experienced at a 
given time. It is suggested that the interaction be tween the natal divisional charts and 
the transit rasi chart helps in coarse timing of ev ents and the interaction between the 
natal rasi chart and transit divisional charts help s in fine timing of events. Some 
techniques based on ashtakavarga, kakshyas and sodh ya pindas are also given in this 
chapter. 
 
25.8  Answer to the Exercises 
 
Exercise 38: 
 
Natal D-4 chart and transit rasi chart are given in Chart 63. Lagna is in Sg in natal D-
4. The 9 
th  house of fortune in a foreign land is in Le and it  contains Rahu, the 
significator of foreign things. So Le stands for li fe in a foreign land in this D-4. Four 
planets occupy it in the transit rasi chart, includ ing Jupiter, Mercury and Mars. 
Jupiter owns lagna in natal D-4 and he shows the na tive from the point of view of 
residence and fortune. Mercury owns lagna in natal rasi chart and he shows the 
physical self of the native. Mars owns the 12 th  house in natal D-4 and he shows 
living in distant places. All these planets activat e Le in their rasi chart transit. So 
foreign journey is a possibility. In addition, Rahu  is in Sg in the transit rasi chart and 
Sg contains lagna in natal D-4. So foreign influence on residence is fortified. 
 
Natal rasi chart and transit D-4 chart are given in  Chart 64. Lagna in Vi shows the 
nativity. Rahu in Vi in transit D-4 shows foreign i nfluence on Vi in the matter of 
residence. Since Vi represents the nativity in nata l lagna, this D-4 transit supports 
going abroad.

house in the natal rasi chart. This shows a long tr ip. Aries (8 th  house) and Mars (8 th  
lord) show changes in the natal rasi chart. Taurus (9 th  house) shows flourishing in a 
foreign land. Aries contains two malefics and Mars occupies Taurus, in transit D-4. 

--- Page 356 ---
  
 
 344 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
This shows the changes in residence and the tempora ry troubles of adjusting to a 
foreign land. Interaction between the natal rasi ch art and transit divisional charts 
shows finer and momentary details. 
 
Final Answer : The native left his motherland and landed in USA on that date. 
 
Exercise 39: 
 
See Chart 65. The rasi transits that stand out are:  (1) benefics Jupiter and Venus in 
Aq with Ketu and (2) three malefics in Ar, with two of them being very strong. 
 
Ar has the 11 
th  house in natal D-24 and shows gains. It also conta ins Guru pada (A9 
– arudha pada of the 9 th  house). Its lord Mars and exalted Sun occupy it in  the transit 
rasi chart and that can show gains in the area of l ife represented by D-24, i.e.  
knowledge and learning. With A9 in D-24 activated b y rasi transits, some 
developments related to guru are also possible. 
 
Now look at Jupiter and Venus. They are in Aq in th e transit rasi chart. What does 
Aq stand for in the natal D-24? It is the 9 
th  house and it shows one’s teacher. Transit 
of Jupiter and Venus in it can show coming under the influence of a guru. 
 
Final Answer : The native was accepted as a sishya (disciple) by a Jyotish guru on the 
given date. 
 
Exercise 40: 
 
Sun, Mercury and Saturn have 6, 6 and 5 rekhas (res pectively) in Libra in their D-10 
BAV’s. So their Libra transit is good for D-10 rela ted matters. SAV contains 36 
rekhas in Libra and that adds to it. Jupiter is als o strong with 6 rekhas in Sg in his D-
10. A few planets are very well-placed. Saturn is e xalted in natal D-10 and he is 
exalted in transit chart also. On the whole, transits look very good. 
 
Final Answer : This D-10 belongs to Rajiv Gandhi, assassinated f ormer PM of India. 
The transit chart belongs to the time when he became the Prime Minister of India.

26.  Transits: Miscellaneous Topics 
 
26.1  Introduction 
 
In the chapter “Transits and Natal References”, we concentrated on correlating the 
natal chart and the transit chart using the rasis o ccupied by planets in both. There are 
some principles about rasi transits that we haven’t  yet covered. We will cover a 
couple of concepts in this chapter. 
 
Nakshatras are also an important division of the zo diac and they are as important as 
rasis. By looking at the interactions between the n akshatras occupied by planets in 
the natal and transit charts, we can make some pred ictions about the results given by 
them at the time of the transit. We will look at a few principles. 
 
26.2  Murthis (Forms/Idols) 
 
To judge the results given by a planet during its t ransit in a particular rasi, find 
exactly when the planet enters the rasi. Find the h ouse occupied by transit Moon at 
that time with respect to his own (Moon’s) natal position. Ba sed on the house, we 
say that the planet is a golden or silver or copper  or iron form during its transit in the 
rasi. The list of houses and murthis is given in Table 62. 
 
Table 62: Murthis 
House Murthi Meaning Results 
1st , 6 th , 11 th  Swarna Golden form Highly favorable 
2nd , 5 th , 9 th  Rajata Silver form Favorable 
3rd , 7 th , 10 th  Taamra Copper form Unfavorable 
4th , 8 th , 12 th  Loha Iron form Highly unfavorable 
 
Let us take Mercury’s transit in Gemini during May 26, 2000 – Aug 3, 2000. 
Mercury entered Gemini at 3:06 pm (IST) on May 26, 2000. At that time, Moon was 
at 10º 29' in Aquarius. We should find which house Aquarius is with respect to natal 

--- Page 359 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 347  
 
Moon and then refer to Table 62 to find out which m urthi Mercury is for a particular 
person during May 26-Aug 3, 2000. 
 
Suppose someone has natal Moon in Aquarius. Then Mo on at the time of Mercury’s 
rasi entry is in the 1 
st  house from natal Moon. So Mercury is a swarna murthi (golden 
form) for that person during his Ge transit and wil l give full results. Suppose 
someone has natal Moon in Pisces ( e.g.  Bill Gates, whose chart was considered 
earlier). Aquarius is the 12 th  house from Pisces. So Mercury is a loha murthi (ir on 
form) during his Ge transit. That is highly unfavor able. Even if it is a favorable 
transit otherwise, Mercury may not give his full re sults. If it is an unfavorable transit 
otherwise, then Mercury will make the native suffer much. 
 
26.3  Rasi Gochara Vedha 
 
We listed the good and bad houses for all planets t o transit from natal Moon in a 
previous chapter. Even when a planet is transiting in a favorable house from natal 
Moon, it may be “obstructed” by another planet tran siting in the vedha sthana (house 
of obstruction). In that case, the planet cannot gi ve its good results. The vedha 
sthaanas of all good transits of all planets are listed in Table 63.

Saturn 3 (12),  6 (9),  11 (5) 
 
Let us take Bill Gates, who has natal Moon in Pisce s. Natal lagna and arudha lagna 
lord Mercury transits in Gemini during June 2000. A s Mercury transiting in the 4 
th  
house from natal Moon is auspicious, this transit s hould bring good results. We can 
find the vedha sthaana for the 4 th  house transit of Mercury from the above table. It is 
the 3 rd  house. If there are planets in Taurus, the 3 rd  house from Pisces, then they 

--- Page 360 ---
  
 
 348 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
cause vedha (obstruction) on Mercury. There were se veral planets causing vedha on 
Mercury on June 8, 2000, when the company of Mr. Ga tes received a legal setback. 
With vedha from many planets, Mercury cannot give h is good results. Moreover, 
Mercury is a loha murthi as we discussed earlier. 
 
This is how one should use the above table. Only ex ceptions are the father and son 
pairs: 
 
(1)  Sun and Saturn do not cause vedha on each other. 
(2)  Moon and Mercury do not cause vedha on each other. 
 
It is important to consider vedhas and murthis to u nderstand why a planet expected 
to produce brilliant results gives only marginal results sometimes. 
 
26.4  Taras (Stars) 
 
26.4.1  Basic Tara Classification 
 
We can count constellations from the constellation of natal Moon to the constellation 
occupied by a planet in transit. Suppose natal Moon  is in Makha and transit Mars is 
in Swaati. Counting constellations from Makha, we g et (1) Maksha, (2) Poorva 
Phalguni, (3) Uttara Phalguni, (4) Hasta, (5) Chitr a and (6) Swaati. So Swaati is the 
6
th  constellation from natal Moon’s constellation. 
 
Different constellations from the constellation of natal Moon stand for different 
things, as shown in Table 64. If a planet is in a bad tara in its transit, it cannot give its 
full results. If dasa lord and antardasa lord as pe r Vimsottari dasa are in bad taras, 
bad results can be expected. 
 
Let us take an example. Bill Gates has natal Moon in Uttarabhadrapada constellation. 
His company received an adverse ruling from a judge  who ordered a breakup of the 
company, on June 8, 2000. Saturn and Jupiter were t ransiting in Krittika, Sun, Venus 
and Mars were in Mrigasira. From Uttarabhadrapada, Krittika is the 5 
th  star, i.e.  
pratyak tara (star of obstacles), and Mrigasira is the 7 th  star, i.e.  naidhana tara (star of 
death). With 5 planets transiting in bad taras, tara bala (strength of stars) was weak.  

--- Page 361 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 349  
 
Table 64: Taras 
Constellation (from 
natal Moon’s 
constellation) 
Name Meaning 
1st , 10 th , 19 th  Janma Tara Birth (mixed) 
2nd , 11 th , 20 th  Sampat Tara Wealth (good) 
3rd , 12 th , 21 st  Vipat Tara Danger (bad) 
4th , 13 th , 22 nd  Kshema Tara Well-being (good) 
5th , 14 th , 23 rd  Pratyak Tara Obstacles (bad) 
6th , 15 th , 24 th  Saadhana Tara Achievement (good) 
7th , 16 th , 25 th  Naidhana/Vadha Tara Death (bad) 
8th , 17 th , 26 th  Mitra Tara Friend (good) 
9th , 18 th , 27 th  Parama Mitra Tara Best friend (good) 
 
Taras are also used in muhurtas. At the time of an auspicious effort or when a new 
project is launched, transit Moon should not be in a bad constellation with respect to 
the natal Moon’s constellation. 
 
26.4.2  Special Nakshatras/Taras 
 
In addition to the above general classification, we  have a few special nakshatras for 
each person: 
 
(1)  The constellation occupied by natal Moon is called Janma  nakshatra. Janma 
means “birth” and this nakshatra shows general well-being. 
(2)  The 10 
th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Karma  nakshatra. Karma 
means “profession” and this nakshatra shows profession and workplace. 
(3)  The 18 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called S aamudaayika  
nakshatra. Saamudaayika roughly means “related to a  crowd” and this 
nakshatra shows group activities. 
(4)  The 16 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Sanghaatika nakshatra. 
Sanghaatika roughly means “belonging to group” and this nakshatra shows 
group/social activities. 
(5)  The 4 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Jaati  nakshatra. Jaati 
roughly means “community” and this nakshatra shows one’s community. To be 
more correct, one’s jaati shows people who belong t o the same class, nature 
and profession. 

--- Page 362 ---
  
 
 350 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(6)  The 7 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Naidhana  nakshatra. 
Naidhana means “death” and this nakshatra shows death and suffering. 
(7)  The 12 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Desa  nakshatra. Desa 
means “country” and this nakshatra shows one’s country. 
(8)  The 13 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Abhisheka  nakshatra. 
Abhisheka means “coronation” and this nakshatra sho ws power and authority. 
This is also called Raajya nakshatra (kingdom). 
(9)  The 19 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Aadhaana  nakshatra. 
Aadhaana means “epoch/conception” and this nakshatr a shows well-being of 
family. 
(10)  The 22 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Vainaasika/Vinaasana 
nakshatra. Vainaasika means “destructive” and this nakshatra shows one’s 
destruction. 
(11)  The 25 th  constellation from janma  nakshatra is called Maanasa  nakshatra. 
Maanasa means “mind” and this nakshatra shows one’s mental state. 
 
Benefics or malefics situated in these constellatio ns in their transit bring good or bad 
results related to the area covered by the nakshatr a. However, it should be kept in 
mind that the results will be with respect to the n ative. For example, malefics 
transiting in desa nakshatra may not ruin one’s cou ntry. After all, any country has 
almost the same number of people with desa nakshatr a in each constellation. When 
many malefics are transiting in desa nakshatra, one  may be driven away from one’s 
country or start hating one’s country. Similarly, m any malefics transiting in jaati 
nakshatra may alienate one from one’s community.  M any benefics transiting in 
karma nakshatra may give success at workplace. This is how these special nakshatras 
should be used. Sometimes, using these nakshtras gi ves special insights that cannot 
be gained by looking at any divisional chart. 
 
As an example, let us take Bill Gates who has natal  Moon in Uttarabhadrapada. His 
jaati nakshatra is the 4 
th  from Uttarabhadrapada, i.e.  Bharani. His karma nakshatra is 
the 10 th  from Uttarabhadrapada, i.e.  Pushyami. When Saturn was transiting in 
Bharani, several people in the software community t urned against Bill Gates and 
gave damaging testimonies in a lawsuit to determine  whether his company was a 
monopoly employing unfair tactics against competito rs. He was more or less 
alienated in the community of software entrepreneur s. At the same time, Rahu was 
transiting in Pushyami and that brought tension related to litigation at his workplace. 
 

--- Page 363 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 351  
 
Exercise 41:  Consider a native born in Leo lagna. He has Moon a lso in Leo in 
Poorva Phalguni constellation. Let us say Jupiter i s transiting in Sg in 
Poorvaashaadha constellation with Mars. Mars is a y ogakaraka from natal lagna. 
Jupiter is transiting in his moolatrikona, in the 5 th  house from natal lagna and Moon. 
That’s very favorable transit. Find out if transit Jupiter and transit Mars are in a 
special nakshatra. Based on it, try to guess the ar ea in which the transit did good to 
the native. 
 
Exercise 42:  For a native with lagna in Leo, natal Moon is in t he 4 
th  quarter of 
Dhanishtha. When the transit chart contains Saturn in Bharani, identify a possible 
result. 
 
Exercise 43: For a native with natal Moon in the 3 
rd  quarter of Poorvabhadrapada 
and lagna in Virgo, transit of Mars in Aasresha con stellation in Cancer brought 
material gains. Cancer is the 6 th  from natal Moon and 11 th  from natal lagna. Both are 
favorable transits and so it makes sense that this transit gave material gains. Now 
find out if Mars occupies a special constellation a nd, based on it, guess the nature of 
the gains.

th  and 15 th  constellations from them. Mars aspects the 1 st , 
3rd , 7 th , 8 th  and 15 th  constellations from him. Mercury and Venus aspect the 1 st  and 
15 th  constellations from them. Jupiter aspects the 10 th , 15 th  and 19 th  constellations 
from him. Saturn aspects the 3 rd , 5 th , 15 th  and 19 th  constellations from him. 
 
A natural benefic gives good results related to the  constellations aspected by it and a 
natural malefic  gives bad results related to the constellations aspected by it. 
 
Exercise 44: For the native of Exercise 42, transit Mars was in  Swaati when transit 
Saturn was in Bharani. Identify the constellations aspected by Mars and see if any 
special constellations are included. If so, predict the possible result.

26.6  Constellations and Body Parts 
 
When they are transiting in various constellations as counted from janma nakshatra , 
planets are said to dwell in different parts of one ’s body and correspondingly some 
standard results are attributed. These results are given in Table 65 – Table 69. 
 
There are two different purposes for these tables: 
 
(1)  We can find the standard results for planetary tran sits in different constellations 
with respect to the constellation of natal Moon. 
(2)  If a native has a disease or problem in a particula r body part, we may be able to 
use these tables and figure out the planet causing it. That can help us in deciding 
the right remedial measures. We can also take preve ntive measures before the 
transit.

If a planet dwells in the left hand in transit and some natural malefics aspect it or 
cause vedha on it, then the planet may give sufferi ng related to the left hand. Some 
injuries to the left hand are possible then. 
 
Let us consider a native who has natal Moon in the 1 
st  quarter of Visakha. He had 
some persistent pain in his chest in February 2000.  Let us determine the planet 
responsible for it. 
 
One can find from Table 65  that Sun dwells in ches t during his transit in the 6 
th , 7 th , 
8th  and 9 th  nakshatras from janma nakshatra. From Visakha, the y are Uttaraashaadha, 
Sravana, Dhanishtha and Satabhisha. Sun transited i n these stars during Jan 11-Mar 
3, 2000. The chest troubles when Sun was dwelling in chest can be related to Sun. 
 
At the time Sun entered Capricorn in January 2000, Moon was in Ar and hence Sun 
is a taamra murthi (copper form) for people with na tal Moon in Li. At the time Sun 
entered Aquarius in February 2000, Moon was in Ta a nd hence Sun is a loha murthi 
(iron form) for people with natal Moon in Li. Being  a copper/iron form dwelling in 
the chest, Sun brought chest pains. 
 
26.7  Latta (Kick) 
 
Latta is a nakshatra-based planetary kick. Each pla net has latta (kick) on a 
constellation based on its transit position. If a t ransit planet has latta on the 
constellation occupied by Moon (or lagna) in natal chart, then we may expect some 
unfavorable results related to the signification of the planet in natal chart. 
 
Purolatta (forward kick): 
 
(1)  Sun has latta on the 12 
th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direct ion. 
If Sun is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta o n the 12 th  nakshatra from 
Mrigasira, i.e.  Visakha. 

--- Page 367 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 355  
 
(2)  Mars has latta on the 3 rd  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direct ion. 
If Mars is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta on the 3 rd  nakshatra from 
Mrigasira, i.e.  Punarvasu. 
(3)  Jupiter has latta on the 6 th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direct ion. 
If Jupiter is in Krittika, for example, he has latt a on the 6 th  nakshatra from 
Krittika, i.e.  Pushyami. 
(4)  Saturn has latta on the 8 th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direct ion. 
If Saturn is in Krittika, for example, he has latta  on the 8 th  nakshatra from 
Krittika, i.e.  Makha. 
 
Prishtha latta (backward kick): 
 
(5)  Moon has latta on the 22 
nd  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 
direction. If Moon is in Anuradha, for example, he has latta on the 22 nd  nakshatra 
(backwards) from Anuradha, i.e.  Dhanishtha. 
(6)  Mercury has latta on the 7 th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 
direction. If Mercury is in Punarvasu, for example,  he has latta on the 7 th  
nakshatra (backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e.  Aswini. 
(7)  Venus has latta on the 5 th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 
direction. If Venus is in Mrigasira, for example, h e has latta on the 5 th  nakshatra 
(backwards) from Mrigasira, i.e.  Aswini. 
(8)  Rahu has latta on the 9 th  nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward direction. 
If Rahu is in Punarvasu, for example, he has latta on the 9 th  nakshatra 
(backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e.  Uttarabhadrapada. 
 
If the 6 
th  lord has latta on janma nakshatra (nakshatra occup ied by natal Moon) or 
lagna nakshatra (nakshatra occupied by natal lagna)  in his transit, then some troubles 
related to litigation or disease or enemies may be expected. If the 7 th  lord has latta on 
janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in his transit, then some troubles related to 
marriage or spouse or relations can be expected. If  an important planet in the 10 th  
house in natal chart has a latta on janma nakshatra  or lagna nakshatra in transit, then 
some troubles in career may be expected. We usually  see some loss related to the 
natal significations of a planet having latta on ja nma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in 
transit. This is an important concept and readers should memorize the latta formulas.

 356 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 113: Let us consider a native whose janma nakshatra is Poorvabhadrapada 
and lagna nakshatra is Hasta. Let us see if any bad  result is possible, using lattas, on 
the evening of 5 th  December 1996. 
 
Let us find if any planet has latta on Poorvabhadrapada or Hasta.

Venus Visaakha 5 th  Backward Uttaraphalguni 
Saturn Uttarabhadrapada 8 th  Forward Aardra 
Rahu Hasta 9 th  Backward Mrigasira 
 
Natal lagna is in Virgo, as Hasta is in Virgo. Ther e are two lattas on lagna nakshatra 
– Hasta. One is by 8 
th  lord Mars and the other is by lagna lord Mercury. So bad 
results relating to 1 st  and 8 th  houses are possible. The 6 th  and 8 th  houses show 
accidents. 
 
However, latta on janma nakshatra is more important . Here Jupiter has latta on 
Poorvabhadrapada. Jupiter owns the 4 
th  and 7 th  houses in the natal chart. So some 
misfortune related to vehicle or house or marital life is possible. 
 
The native had a vehicular accident on the evening of 5 
th  December 1996, in which 
his car was totaled; i.e.  it was so damaged that his insurance company found  it 
cheaper to give a new car instead of repairing it. 
 
Exercise 45: Consider the chart of Bill Gates (see Chart 24). O n 8 
th  June 2000, his 
company received an unfavorable ruling from a US ju dge in a landmark anti-trust 
lawsuit. Find if any planets had latta on janma nak shatra or lagna nakshatra at the 
time of the ruling. Find the common house related to those planets in the natal chart.

26.8  Sarvatobhadra Chakra 
 
Definition: Sarvatah means “everywhere” or “entirely”. Bhadra m eans “auspicious” 
or “well”. Sarvatobhadra chakra is a chart that sho ws all-round well-being and all 
kinds of auspicious and inauspicious results. 
Figure 3: Sarvatobhadra Chakra 
 

--- Page 370 ---
  
 
 358 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
There are 9 
x 9 = 81 squares in the chart. Middle 7 squares on t he outer borders 
contains 7 nakshatras each. Abhijit (the last quart er of Uttarashadha) is included 
among the nakshatras. The innermost 5 squares conta ins weekdays and tithis (lunar 
days). The notation regarding tithis is: 
 
(1)  The entry Nanda represents 1 
st , 6 th , 11 th , 16 th , 21 st  and 26 th  tithis. 
(2)  The entry Bhadra represents 2 nd , 7 th , 12 th , 17 th , 22 nd  and 27 th  tithis. 
(3)  The entry Jaya represents 3 rd , 8 th , 13 th , 18 th , 23 rd  and 28 th  tithis. 
(4)  The entry Rikta represents 4 th , 9 th , 14 th , 19 th , 24 th  and 29 th  tithis. 
(5)  The entry Poorna represents 5 th , 10 th , 15 th , 20 th  and 30 th  tithis. 
 
Rasis are also included in the chart. Some consonan ts are listed in the squres just 
inside the border squares. All the squares lying on  diagonals of the chart, except the 
central square of the chart, contain vowels. There are 16 vowels and 20 consonants 
that are covered. We see that 16 (vowels) + 20 (con sonants) + 12 (rasis) + 28 
(nakshtras) + 5 (tithis and weekdays) = 81. 
 
Vedha: When a planet occupies a nakshatra, it causes vedha  (obstruction) on the 
contents of the squares along 3 lines. We can draw one vertical or horizontal line and 
two crossward lines starting at the nakshatra. Cont ents of the squares on the lines 
have vedha from the planet. 
 
Example 114: Let us say Saturn is in Punarvasu. We see that Pun arvasu is on the 
eastern border. 
 
Drawing a horizontal line to the west from it, we s ee that the consonant h, rasi Cn, 
vowel au, tithis Bhadra (2 
nd , 7 th , 12 th , 17 th , 22 nd  and 27 th ), weekdays Monday and 
Wednesday, vowel am, rasi Sc, consonant y and const ellation Moola are on this line. 
So Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these. 
 
Drawing a crossward line to the northwest from it, we see that the consonant k, rasis 
Ta and Ar, consonant d and constellation Poorva Bha drapada are on this line. So 
Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these. 
 

--- Page 371 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 359  
 
Drawing a crossward line to the southwest from it, we see that the consonant d 
(alveolar), consonant m and constellation Uttara Ph alguni are on this line. So Saturn 
in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these. 
 
Exercise 46:  Find all the consonants, vowels, tithis, weekdays,  rasis and 
constellations on which Venus in Makha has vedha. 
 
There are some special principles: 
 
(1)  A planet in the first quarter of Krittika or the la st quarter of Bharani has vedha on 
the vowel “a” which is in the northeastern corner. A similar thing applies to all 
the vowels in corners. 
(2)  If an vowel has vedha, its similar vowel ( e.g.  a and aa, i and ee, u and uu) also 
has vedha from the same planet. 
(3)  Some consonants are not covered in this chart. Plan ets in Ardra have vedha on g, 
chh and ng (nasal). Planets in Hasta have vedha on h, n (alveolar) and th 
(alveolar). Planets in Poorvashadha have vedha on d h (dental), ph and dh 
(alveolar). Planets in Uttara Bhadrapada have vedha  on th (dental), jh and nch 
(nasal). 
(4)  If a planet has vedha on one of the following pairs  of consonants, it has vedha on 
the other one too: b & v; s & sh (palatal); kh & sh (alveolar); j & y; ng & tr. 
 
Using Sarvatobhadra Chakra 
70 : We should find the following in the natal  chart: 
 
(1)  the constellation occupied by Moon or any special tara 
(2)  the rasi occupied by lagna or any house of interest 
(3)  the first/prominent consonant and vowel in the native’s name 
(4)  the tithi of birth (janma tithi) or a special tithi 
(5)  the weekday of birth (janma vaara) 
 
We should study the vedha caused on these by differ ent planets in their transit. 
Vedha by benefics (Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus ) is favorable and vedha by 
malefics (Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu) is unfa vorable. If several transiting 
benefics have simultaneous vedha on several natal p oints listed above, then good 
results may be expected. Malefics, on the other hand, give bad results. 
                                                
 
70  This author’s experience in the use of Sarvatobhadra Chakra is very very limited.

 360 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
In addition to considering janma nakshatra, we can consider special nakshatras 
related to the matter of interest. Suppose we want to find the transit results related to 
career. Then we can take karma nakshatra of natal c hart and see the vedhas on it in 
transit chart. 
 
Similarly, we can take the tithi corresponding to t he matter of interest. For example, 
we can take “karma tithi” (lunar day of profession)  instead of janma tithi when 
finding transit results related to career. 
 
Readers should refer to the first chapter for the p rocedure of finding tithis. Karma 
tithi is a little different from normal tithi. To f ind karma tithi, we multiply the 
difference between Moon’s longitude and Sun’s longi tude with 10 and reduce the 
product to a value between 0º and 360º (by adding o r subtracting multiples of 360º). 
We divide it by 12 and add 1 to the quotient. That gives a number between 1 and 30 
and that represents “karma tithi”. Karma tithi chan ges 10 times as fast as normal 
tithi. Similarly “dhana tithi” (lunar day of wealth ) changes twice as fast as normal 
tithi. We can find a tithi for several matters. The  tithi relevant to the matter of 
interest should be used when finding vedha of trans iting planets on tithis (Nanda, 
Bhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Poorna). 
 
Let us take an example. If the 10 
th  house, karma nakshatra, karma tithi and janma 
vaara all have the vedha of a couple of transiting benefics, then some good 
developments may take place in the native’s career.  If they have the vedha of a 
couple of malefics (instead of benefics), then we c an expect setbacks in the native’s 
career. In this manner, we study the impact of tran sits on important tithis, janma 
vaara, important nakshatras and important houses in  natal chart. If just one natal 
reference has vedha from just one planet, we cannot  make any predictions. But, if 2-
3 natal reference have vedha from a couple of benef ic/malefic transit planets, then 
we can be more confident. However, a prediction sho uld be made only if dasas and 
Tajaka charts also show an event.  
 
Example 115: Let us consider the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The data of birth 
and death can be found in Example 107.  
 

--- Page 373 ---
 
 
 Part 3: Transit Analysis 361  
 
Janma tithi is Sukla Ashtami (8 th  tithi) and it belongs to the Jaya group. Janma vaa ra 
is Thursday 71 . Jama nakshatra is Dhanishtha. Vainasika nakshatra  (destruction) is in 
Anooradha. Naidhana nakshatra (constellation of dea th) is in Bharani. If all these 
natal reference points have vedha from a couple of natural malefics, then death is 
more likely on other days. Of course, one will not die whenever this happens, but 
this will increase the chances of death. 
 
In the transit chart, Saturn is in naidhana nakshat ra Bharani. Mars is in Swati. Rahu 
is in Asresha. Ketu is in Sravanam. 
 
If we draw crossward lines from Ketu in Sravanam an d Saturn in Bharani, we can 
see that they intersect in the square containing Ja ya and Thursday. So janma tithi 
(Jaya) and janma vaara (Thursday) have vedha from K etu and Saturn. Janma 
nakshatra Dhanishtha has vedha from Ketu in Sravana m and Rahu in Asresha. 
Vainaasika nakshatra Anooradha also comes under the  vedha of Saturn in Bharani 
and Rahu in Asresha. The house of accidents Cp, whi ch is the 3 
rd  house from AL in 
natal chart, comes under vedha from Ketu in Sravanam and Mars in Swati. 
 
Considering that several key natal references are c oming under the vedha of a couple 
of malefics, unfavorable results are possible. Cons idering the involvement of 
naidhana and vainaasika nakshatras, death is possible. 
 
Example 116:  Let us consider Rajiv Gandhi’s ascension to power in India on 
October 31, 1984. It was covered in Exercise 40. Ra si chart of Mr. Gandhi can be 
found in Chart 39. 
 
At the time of the event, Jupiter was in Poorvashad ha, Venus was in Jyeshtha, 
Mercury was in Visakha and Moon was in Sravanam. Le t us see if they have vedhas 
on any important natal references. Here are the vedhas: 
 
(1)  Jupiter and Mercury both have vedha on Nanda and Su nday. Sunday is the 
weekday of birth. The tithi of power (5 
th ) is Sukla Shashthi (Nanda group). 
(2)  Mercury and Moon both have vedha on Dhanishtha (abh isheka nakshatra – 
constellation of coronation). 
                                                 
71  As per the western calendar, Friday came at midnig ht and the native was born at 12:22 am. 
However, a new day starts at sunrise for Hindus. So it was still Thursday. 

--- Page 374 ---
  
 
 362 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(3)  Jupiter and Venus both have vedha on Sg, which is t he 5 th  house of power in 
natal chart. 
(4)  Mercury and Venus both have vedha on Libra, which c ontains GL in natal chart. 
GL is the seat of power. 
 
So janma vaara, an important tithi, an important na kshatra and two important rasis in 
natal chart have vedha from two benefic planets eac h. This is conducive to getting 
political power. 
 
Example 117:  Let us continue with the same native. Rajiv Gandhi ’s party lost 
majority in the elections of November 22, 1989. 
 
When he became India’s Prime Minister in 1984, Jupi ter was in Poorvashadha. 
Poorvashadha is karma nakshatra (constellation of p rofession). At the time of Mr. 
Gandhi’s defeat in 1989, Saturn was in that constellation. 
 
Let us find vedhas by transit planets on the same n atal references considered in the 
last example: 
 
(1)  Nanda and Sunday have vedha from 3 malefics: Saturn in Poorvashadha, Rahu in 
Dhanishtha and Ketu in Asresha. 
(2)  Dhanishtha is Abhisheka nakshatra (constellation of  coronation). It is occupied 
by Rahu and Ketu has vedha on it. 
(3)  The 5 
th  house of power in the natal chart, Sg, has vedha from Mars and Saturn. 
 
For these reasons, transits were unfavorable from t he point of view of political 
power. So Mr. Gandhi’s party lost power. 
 
26.9  Conclusion 
 
Several important topics related to transits in nakshatras were covered in this chapter. 
One should carefully learn and practice all these c lassical nakshatra-based 
techniques. However, new students should not make p redictions just based on these 
techniques. Any technique that divides people into 27 groups and gives the same 
result for everyone in the same group can be correc t only to a limited extent. These 
methods should be used in conjunction with other chart-sensitive methods.

26.10  Answers to the Exercises 
 
Exercise 41: 
 
Poorvaashaadha is the 10 
th  constellation from Poorva Phalguni. So the favorab le 
transit of Jupiter and Mars happens to be in the Karma  nakshatra, which shows 
profession. So the good results to be experienced may be related to profession. 
 
Final Answer : The details belong to Rajiv Gandhi. He suddenly b ecame India’s 
Prime Minister during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier. 
 
Exercise 42: 
 
Bharani is the 7 
th  constellation from Dhanishtha, i.e.  it is the naidhana nakshatra 
(death). Saturn is a malefic and the 7 th  lord – and hence a maraka – here. So this 
transit has the potential to bring death. Of course, not everyone with lagna in Leo and 
Moon in Dhanishtha dies then 72 , but death is a possibility during the transit. 
 
Final Answer : The details belong to John F. Kennedy, Jr. He die d in a plane crash 
during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier. 
 
Exercise 43: 
 
Aasresha is the 12 
th  constellation from Poorvabhaadrapada, i.e.  Desa nakshatra. 
Being a debilitated malefic in desa nakshatra (coun try), Mars can drive him out of 
his country. That was indeed how Mars gave gains to  the native of Chart 63 in the 
second week of November 1994. The native left his motherland India then. 
 
Exercise 44: 
 
Mars aspects the 1 
st , 3 rd , 7 th , 8 th  and 15 th  constellations from him. Mars in Swaati will 
aspect (1) Swaati, (2) Anooradha, (3) Uttaraashaadh a, (4) Sravanam, and, (5) 
Bharani. Because natal Moon is in Dhanishtha, these  are the 20 th , 22 nd , 26 th , 27 th  and 
                                                 
72  These transit principles based on nakshtra give go od insight into future, but one cannot make 
predictions just based on them.

7th  constellations (respectively) from janma nakshatra . Out of these, 2 are special 
nakshatras. The 7 th  constellation is known as naidhana nakshatra and s hows death. 
The 22 nd  nakshatra is known as vainaasika nakshatra and sho ws destruction. Mars 
aspects both. As seen in Exercise 42, maraka in the  natal chart Saturn occupies 
naidhana nakshatra 73 . The predicted result is death. 74  
 
Final Answer : As already mentioned, Mr. Kennedy passed away during this transit. 
 
Exercise 45: 
 
Rahu was in Punarvasu at that time. He had latta on  the 9 
th  from Punarvasu 
backwards, which is Uttarabhadrapada, i.e.  janma nakshatra! So Rahu had latta on 
janma nakshatra. Mars was in Mrigasira at the time and he had latta on the 3 rd  from 
Mrigasira, which is Punarvasu, i.e.  lagna nakshatra! 
 
Rahu occupies the 6 
th  house in the natal chart and Mars owns it. So the setbacks 
given by their lattas on janma nakshatra and lagna nakshatra were related to the 6 th  
house matters – litigation and enemies. 
 
Exercise 46: 
 
(1)  Verical line in the northern direction has uu, d (a lveolar), h, k, v, a, u and 
Bharani. 
(2)  Crossward line in the northeastern direction has Asresha. 
(3)  Crossward line in the northwestern direction has m,  Le, Bhadra (2 
nd , 7 th , 12 th , 
17 th , 22 nd  and 27 th ), Monday, Wednesday, Jaya (3 rd , 8 th , 13 th , 18 th , 23 rd  and 28 th ), 
Thursday, Cp, kh and Sravanam. 
                                                 
73  In the natal chart, Mars occupies his Mrityu Bhaga  (part of death). So his aspect over the two 
special constellations is also significant. 
74  It will be very hasty  to predict someone’s death just based on conjuncti ons and aspects on special 
nakshatras in transit. Out of the many people with the same nakshatra, only those people whose dasas 
and Tajaka charts also show death will die at the time of this death-inflicting transit.

Part 4:  Tajaka Analysis 
 
 
 
A sub-system of Indian astrology, popularly known a s “Tajaka 
system”, is extremely useful in making precise and pointed 
predictions. It considers planetary aspects and yog as different 
from those employed in other classical methods of V edic 
astrology and it is closer to western astrology in terms of 
aspects and yogas. In fact, some scholars may valid ly question 
why Tajaka system is being covered in a book on Ved ic 
astrology. There are no references to it in the works of Parasara, 
Jaimini and other maharshis. The oldest reference t o these 
techniques to be found in the works of a respected authority on 
Vedic astrology is in “Tajaka Neelakanthi”, a work by 
Neelakantha who wrote a celebrated commentary on “J aimini 
Sutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some a uthenticity 
to the system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked 
about this system in parts that are possibly missin g today. We 
will cover this system  in this book, because some illustrious 
scholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and D r. B.V. 
Raman, set the precedent by teaching this system.

 366 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
This system is based on solar return charts. When S un returns 
every year to the position he occupied in the zodia c at the time 
of a person’s birth, a new year is said to commence  for the 
person and a chart drawn for that time is called “T ajaka annual 
chart” or “Tajaka varsha chakra”. Analysis of this chart can 
give insights into what may be in store during the one year 
following the solar return. Results suggested in th e annual chart 
can take place only if they are ‘possible’ based on  natal chart 
also. However, annual chart often gives a finer ins ight into the 
year in question than natal chart. 
 
A few special dasa systems enable timing of events within the 
365-day period of operation of an annual chart. 
 
Similar to the annual charts, “monthly solar return  charts” 
(Tajaka masa chakras) can also be drawn and they ar e useful in 
analyzing a one-month period in depth. 
 
This part explains the casting and use of annual ch arts in giving 
precise predictions.

 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 367  
 
27.  Tajaka Chart Basics 
 
27.1  Casting Annual Charts 
 
Sun moves with respect to earth at the rate of 30 ° per month. He takes one year to 
complete one cycle through the zodiac. He returns t o the position occupied by him at 
the time of one’s birth after every one-year period . At the exact moment when Sun 
returns to the exact position he occupied at the time of a person’s birth, a new year 
is said to commence in the life of that person. A chart can be cast for the 
commencement of the new year. This is called a Taja ka varsha chakra or a Tajaka 
annual chart 
75 . The longitude and latitude of the birthplace must  be used in casting 
this chart, irrespective of the place of living at the commencement of the new year. 
 
The commencement of a new year is called “varsha pr avesh” by some people. 
Varsha means a year and pravesh means entry. 
 
Example 118: 
 
Let us take a native with this birthdata: 8 
th  March 1967, 5:40 pm (IST), 73 E 04, 26 
N 18. Sun occupies 23 ° 50' 25'' in Aq in his birthchart. Suppose we want analyze the 
one-year period of March 2000-March 2001 using Tajaka annual chart. 
 
Then we should find the date and time when Sun ente rs 23 ° 50' 25'' in Aq in March 
2000. We find that Sun enters this position at 4:41 :21 am on 8 
th  March 2000. The 
native finishes 33 years and enters his 34 th  year at that time. 
 
We can erect a chart with the following data: 8 
th  March 2000, 4:41:21 am (IST), 73 E 
04, 26 N 18 76 . That chart is called the native’s Tajaka annual c hart for 2000-2001. 
Rasi chart erected with this data is shown in Chart  66. Along with this rasi chart, we 
can draw all the divisional charts at this time. 
                                                
 
75  Western astrologers also use similar charts and ca ll them “solar return” charts. Some Indian 
astrologers call these “varshaphal” charts. Varshaphal means “results for one year”. 
76  Even if the native is living on the other side of the globe, we must still cast the annual chart for 
birthplace co-ordinates. So we are using the longitude and latitude of his birthplace here.

Chart 66 
 
 
By analyzing this rasi chart and the associated div isional charts, we can find out the 
fortune of the native during the year. The matters shown by various divisional charts, 
houses, rasis, planets, arudha padas etc  remain the same. To time events within this 
year, we have annual dasas. We will learn them in later chapters. 
 
27.2  An Approximate Method 
 
The exact time of the commencement of new year is d etermined by finding the exact 
time when Sun enters the exact position occupied by  him at the time of one’s birth. 
However, this can be a laborious calculation to do manually. To make this task less 
challenging, some scholars devised approximate meth ods based on the number of 
days in an average solar year. A sidereal solar yea r has 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 
and 12 seconds. Based on this, the amount of time to be added to the birthdata to find 
the varsha pravesh data is given in Table 71.

Procedure: 
 
(1)  Find the birthday as per western calendar in the required year. 
(2)  Find the years completed. Find the corresponding da ys, hours, minutes and 
seconds from Table 71. If the age is not in the lis t, express it as a sum of entries 
found in the table and add their values. For exampl e, suppose someone finished 
46 years. Then add the values given for 40 years and 6 years. 
(3)  Add the days found above to the weekday 
77  of birth and find the resulting 
weekday. Find the nearest date to the birthday foun d in (1) that falls on this 
weekday. A time equal to the birthtime on this date is taken as a reference. 
                                                 
77  Remember that the weekday in Hindu calendar changes at sunrise and not at 12:00 midnight. 

--- Page 382 ---
  
 
 370 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(4)  Add the hours, minutes and seconds found in (2) to the reference date and time 
found in (3). The result is the date and time of the commencement of new year. 
(5)  Find the planetary positions, lagna etc  at this time for the longitude and latitude 
of the birthplace. 
 
Let us now revisit Example 118 and calculate varsha  pravesh data using this 
approximate method. 
 
(1)  Birthday is 8 
th  March 1967. The 34 th  year starts in 2000. The birthday as per the 
western calendar is on 8 th  March 2000. 
(2)  Finished years are 33 = 30 + 3. Adding the entries of 30 years and 3 years, we get 
Days Hrs Min Sec 
30 years:  2 16 34 54 (from Table 71) 
3 years:  3 18 27 30 (from Table 71) 
33 years (sum): 6 11 02 24 
(3)  Birthday (8 
th  March 1967) is a Wednesday. Adding 6 days to it, w e get a 
Tuesday. We now have to find the Tuesday nearest to  8 th  March 2000. It is 7 th  
March 2000. The time of birth on 8 th  March 1967 is 5:40 pm and we now take 
5:40 pm on 7 th  March 2000 as the reference time. 
(4)  We have to add 11 hours, 2 minutes and 24 seconds f ound in (2) to the reference 
time in (3). We get 4:42:24 am on 8 th  March 2000. 
(5)  We find rasi chart and all divisional charts for th e data: 8 th  March 2000, 4:42:24 
am (IST), 73 E 04, 26 N 18. 
 
Please note that the time found here is wrong only by 1 minute. In some examples, 
the error resulting from the approximation can be h igher. However, this approximate 
method is very convenient and quick. 
 
N
OTE : Errors due to ayanamsa and approximations in the calculation of Sun’s 
longitude cause greater errors than this approximat ion. As long as one takes the 
correct nonlinear nature  of ayanamsa change into account, there will not be  any 
considerable discrepancy in the varsha pravesh times found by people using different 
ayanamsas. But ignoring the nonlinear nature of aya namsa results in considerable 
errors in varsha pravesh time. This is because lagna moves 360 times faster than Sun. 

--- Page 383 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 371  
 
Any small errors in Sun’s longitude result in error s in lagna which are 360 times as 
large. 
 
Exercise 47: Find the varsha pravesh data for the 27 
th  year of the native in Example 
118 using ( a) the approximate method and ( b) the exact method. 
 
27.3  Casting Monthly Charts 
 
A year is divided into 12 months and a new chart ca n be cast at the commencement 
of every new month. This is called Tajaka maasa chakra or a Tajaka monthly chart. 
 
The commencement of a new month is called “maasa pravesh” by some people. 
 
A year is the period in which Sun moves by 360º. A month is the period in which 
Sun moves by 30º. 
 
Let us take the native of Example 118. He was born on 8 
th  March 1967. Sun was at 
23 ° 50' 25'' in Aq when he was born. On 8 th March 2000, Sun enters 23 ° 50' 25'' in 
Aq at 4:41:21 am (IST) and a new year commences the n. This is the 34 th  year in the 
life of the native. 
 
Along with the new year, a new month commences then . This is the first month of 
the year. This month ends and a new month commences  after Sun moves by exactly 
30 °. Sun enters 23 ° 50' 25'' in Pi on 7 
th  April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The second month 
in the year commences then. We can cast rasi chart and divisional charts at that 
moment. Using those charts, we can predict events i n the next one-month period. 
This month ends and the third month commences when Sun enters 23 ° 50' 25'' in Ar. 
 
Thus, when Sun enters 23 ° 50' 25'' in different rasis, we cast different mon thly charts 
and use them for predicting the events in a one-month period. The thing to remember 
here is that “one month” is the time when Sun moves by exactly 30 °. 
 
There isn’t any good approximate method for casting  monthly charts. Sun takes 
approximately the same time for moving by 360 ° and so we have an approximate 
method for annual charts. But the time Sun takes to  move by 30 ° varies considerably 
from month to month. So there isn’t any approximate  method that gives decent 

--- Page 384 ---
  
 
 372 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
results. It may be wise to exactly cast 12 monthly charts for the first year of the 
native and then find monthly charts in later years from them, using the approximate 
method given for annual charts. 
 
27.4  Casting Sixty-hour Charts 
 
A month is again divided into 12 shashti-horas. Eac h shashti-hora period consists of 
60 hours, i.e. 2.5 days. At the beginning of every shashti-hora, a  Tajaka shashti-hora 
chakra 
78  (Tajaka sixty-hour chart) is cast. In the period c orresponding to each Tajaka 
sixty-hour chart, Sun moves by 2º30'. 
 
In other words, we can cast a chart after every 2º3 0' motion of Sun and use that 
Tajaka sixty-hour chart to predict events in the 2. 5-day period commencing then. 
There are exactly 12 such charts in a one-month period. 
 
For example, let us take the second month of the ye ar 2000-2001 for the native of 
Example 118. The second month commences when Sun en ters 23 ° 50' 25'' in Pi, i.e.  
on 7 
th  April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The first shashti-hora of the month also starts then. 
It ends and the second shashti-hora or 60-hour peri od commences when Sun is 
advanced by 2º30', i.e.  when Sun enters 26 ° 20' 25'' in Pi. This happens at 11:40:51 
pm (IST) on 9 th  April 2000. If we cast a chart for that moment, we  can make some 
predictions for the next 2.5 days. 
 
27.5  Conclusion 
 
In this chapter, we learnt what Tajaka annual and m onthly charts are and how they 
are cast. When Sun re-enters every year the same lo ngitude occupied by him at the 
time of one’s birth, it signals the commencement of  a new year in the native’s life. 
We can cast a chart for that exact moment and predi ct events in the next one year 
based on that chart. We can also cast monthly charts and sixty-hour charts. 
 
These new years are based on the solar years and th e commencement of new year is 
around  one’s birthday as per the modern western calendar. However, many Indians – 
especially south Indians – celebrate birthday as pe r the lunar calendar. In fact, most 
                                                
 
78  This is popularly known as just “Tajaka Hora Chakra”.

 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 373  
 
Hindu holidays are based on the lunar calendar. For  example, birthdays of Lord 
Rama and Lord Krishna are celebrated based on the tithi  and not based on the solar 
calendar. Lunar calendar is of great importance in Indian culture. Correspondingly, 
there are techniques based on the birthday as per l unar calendar. However, those 
techniques are beyond the scope of this book and we  will restrict ourselves to solar 
birthday and Tajaka annual charts. 
 
27.6  Answers to Exercises 
 
Exercise 47: 
 
(a)  Approximate method: 
 
(1)  The approximate birthday of the 27 
th  year is 8 th  March 1993. He completes 26 
years then. 
(2)  Adding the entries of 20 years and 6 years, we get 4 days 15 hr 58 min 12 sec. 
(3)  Adding 4 days to Wednesday (weekday of birth), we g et Sunday. The nearest 
Sunday to 8 th  March 1993 is 7 th  March 1993. So we take 5:40 pm on 7 th  March 
1993 as the reference time. 
(4)  Add 15 hr 58 min 12 sec to this reference time. We get 9:38:12 am on 8 th  March 
1993. 
 
(b)  Exact method: 
 
Let us find the position of Sun at the above time. At 9:38:12 am (IST) on 8 
th  March 
1993, Sun is at 23 ° 50' 29'' in Aq. Natal position is 23 ° 50' 25'' in Aq. We have to 
subtract about 2 minutes of time to get Sun 4'' beh ind. The correct varshapravesh 
data is – 9:36:18 am (IST) on 8 th  March 1993.

28.  Techniques of Tajaka Charts 
 
28.1  Muntha 
 
Muntha is a concept specific to Tajaka charts. Prog ress lagna in the natal chart at the 
rate of one rasi per year to get muntha in an annua l chart. Suppose someone finishes 
31 years and starts the 32 
nd  year on a given date. Suppose we are casting the a nnual 
chart of the 32 nd  year. Suppose the natal chart has lagna in Sc. The n muntha in the 
annual chart will be the 32 nd  house from Sc, i.e.  the 8 th  house from Sc (after 
expunging multiples of 12 from 32). So muntha is in Ge. 
 
Muntha is very important in Tajaka charts. Muntha i s as important a reference point 
in an annual chart as lagna. The reason may be obvi ous in the chapter on “Sudarsana 
Chakra Dasa”. Some people find muntha in monthly ch arts by progressing natal 
lagna by 2º30' per month. This author takes a diffe rent stand and the readers may be 
able to appreciate this after reading the same chapter. 
 
Look at the planets in muntha. They tell us the nat ure of events in the year or month. 
For example, Jupiter in muntha may give good result s, happiness from children and 
knowledge. Saturn in muntha may make one sluggish, unhealthy, frustrated and 
sorrowful. Of course, the strength of the planets influencing muntha also matters. For 
example, an afflicted and weak Jupiter in muntha ma y give loss of position, bad 
name and scandals. 
 
Position of muntha in various houses with respect t o lagna in the annual chart also 
tells us the nature of events in a year. Situation of muntha in the 9 
th , 10 th  and 11 th  
houses is excellent. It gives prosperity, status an d gains respectively. Situation of 
muntha in the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd  and 5 th  houses is also good. It gives health, wealth, succ ess 
and fame respectively. Situation of muntha in the 6 th , 8 th  and 12 th  houses is bad. It 
gives illness, troubles and expenditures respective ly. Situation of muntha in the 4 th  
house gives disputes and loss of position. Situatio n of muntha in the 7 th  house also 
gives troubles in marriage and many hardships.

 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 375  
 
28.2  Aspects 
 
In Tajaka analysis, we consider the following aspects: 
79  
 
(1)  Trinal aspect: A planet has a strong benefic aspect on the 5 
th  and 9 th  houses 
from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(2)  Sextile aspect: A planet has a weak benefic aspect on the 3 rd  and 11 th  houses 
from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(3)  Square aspect:  A planet has a weak malefic aspect on the 4 th  and 10 th  houses 
from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(4)  Conjunction:  A planet has a strong malefic aspect on the planet s in the same 
house occupied by it. 
(5)  Opposition:  A planet has a strong malefic aspect on the 7 th  house from it and on 
the planets in that house. 
(6)  Semi-sextile aspect:  A planet has a neutral aspect on the 2 nd  and 12 th  houses 
from it and on the planets in those houses. 
 
Deeptamsa is “the orb of an aspect”. Deeptamsas of planets: Sun – 15º, Moon – 12º, 
Mars – 8º, Mercury – 7º, Jupiter – 9º, Venus – 7º, Saturn – 9º. If Venus is at 13º in 
Li, he will have a trinal aspect on Ge, but his asp ect doesn’t cover the entire rasi. 
Venusian aspect covers an angle of 7º from 13º in G emini mainly, though Venus 
may have a moderate aspectual influence on the enti re rasi. So Venus mainly 
influences 6º–20º in Ge by aspect. Deeptamsa is the same for all kinds of  aspects. 
 
28.3  Harsha Bala 
 
Harsha bala 
80  of seven planets is found by adding the strengths given by the 
following 4 sources of strength: 
 
                                                
 
79  These aspects are similar to the ones used in west ern astrology. Considering that graha and rasi 
aspects were mentioned by maharshis, the exact meaning and use of these special aspects needs to b e 
further researched and correctly understood. The cu rrent understanding of scholars may be 
incomplete. Rishi prokta (words spoken by great sages) should form the basis of our knowledge. 
80  Harsha means “cheerful” and bala means “strength”. This is the strength of cheerfulness.

 376 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(1)  Sun in the 9 th  house, Moon in the 3 rd  house, Mars in the 6 th  house, Mercury in the 
1st  house, Jupiter in the 11 th  house, Venus in the 5 th  house and Saturn in the 12 th  
house get 5 units. They get zero units in other houses. 
(2)  A planet in exaltation or own sign gets 5 units (else zero units). 
(3)  Feminine planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn) get 5 units in the 1 st , 2 nd , 
3rd  7 th , 8 th  and 9 th  houses. Masculine planets (Sun, Mars and Jupiter) get 5 units in 
the 4 th , 5 th , 6 th , 10 th , 11 th  and 12 th  houses. 
(4)  If the new year starts in the daytime, masculine pl anets get 5 units each. If the 
new year starts in the night time, feminine planets get 5 units each. 
 
A planet with 20 units of strength is exceedingly s trong. A planet with 15 units of 
strength is fully strong. A planet with 10 units of  strength is of average strength. A 
planet with 5 units of strength has only a little s trength. A planet with zero units of 
strength has no strength at all. 
 
Example 119: Let us find Harsha bala of planets for the annual chart of Example 
118. 
 
(1)  Only Moon is in the prescribed house (the 3 
rd  house in Moon’s case). He gets 5 
units. 
(2)  No planet is in exaltation or own sign. 
(3)  Venus in 1 st , Mercury in 2 nd , Moon in 3 rd  are the feminine planets in prescribed 
houses. Jupiter in 4 th  is in the masculine planet in the prescibed house. 
(4)  Because the new year started at 4:42 am, i.e.  during the night, we give 5 units 
each to the feminine planets – Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. 
 
Adding all the sources, we get 15 for Moon, 10 for Mercury and Venus, 5 for Jupiter 
and Saturn and zero for Sun and Mars. 
 
28.4  Pancha Vargeeya Bala 
 
Panchavargeeya 
81  bala is found using the following procedure: 
 
                                                
 
81  Pancha means “five”. Pancha vargeeya means “from t he group of five”. 

--- Page 389 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 377  
 
28.4.1  Kshetra Bala 
 
Kshetra bala shows the strength in rasi chart. A pl anet in own rasi gets 30 units of 
Kshetra bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi gets 15 u nits of Kshetra bala. A planet in an 
enemy’s rasi gets 7.5 units of Kshetra bala. 
 
28.4.2  Uchcha Bala 
 
Uchcha bala shows how close a planet is from its ex altation point. A planet gets 20 
units of uchcha bala if it is at its deep exaltatio n point (Sun: 10º Ar, Moon: 3º Ta, 
Mars: 28º Cp, Mercury: 15º Vi, Jupiter: 5º Cn, Venu s: 27º Pi, Saturn: 20º Li). At 
180º from its deep exaltation point, a planet is deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of 
uchcha bala. 
 
We can find the longitude difference between a plan et’s position and its deep 
debilitation point and divide it by 180º to get the  fraction that shows how far away it 
is from its debilitation point. Bu multiplying 20 u nits with this fraction, we get 
uchcha bala. 
 
For example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8 °30' in Vi). So he is at 158 °30' from the 
start of the zodiac. His debilitation point is 5 ° in Cp, i.e.  275 °0'. The difference is 
275 °0' – 158 °30' = 116 °30'. Because this is less than 180 °, we don’t have to subtract 
it from 360 °. 
 
Now 116 °30'/180 ° = 0.6472. Multiply 20 with this fraction, we get 1 2.94. So 
Jupiter’s uchcha bala is 12.94 (out of 20). 
 
28.4.3  Hadda Bala 
 
Each rasi is divided into several haddas and differ ent haddas have different lords. 
Hadda is similar to D-30. Table 72 can be used for finding the hadda lords of planets. 
 
Hadda bala shows the strength in hadda. A planet in  own hadda gets 15 units of 
Hadda bala. A planet in a friend’s hadda gets 7.5 u nits of Hadda bala. A planet in an 
enemy’s hadda gets 3.75 units of Hadda bala.

28.4.4  Drekkana Bala 
 
Drekkana bala shows the strength in drekkana chart (D-3). A planet in own rasi in D-
3 gets 10 units of Drekkana bala. A planet in a fri end’s rasi in D-3 gets 5 units of 
Drekkana bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-3 gets 2.5 units of Drekkana bala.

 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 379  
 
28.4.5  Navamsa Bala 
 
Navamsa bala shows the strength in navamsa chart (D -9). A planet in own rasi in D-
9 gets 5 units of Navamsa bala. A planet in a frien d’s rasi in D-9 gets 2.5 units of 
Navamsa bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-9 gets 1.25 units of Navamsa bala. 
 
28.4.6  Final Computation 
 
We find the sum of kshetra bala, uchcha bala, hadda  bala, drekkana bala and 
navamsa bala and divide the sum by 4. The result is  called “Pancha Vargeeya Bala”. 
If it is below 5, the planet is weak. If it is betw een 5 and 10, the planet has ordinary 
strength. If it is between 10 and 15, the planet is  strong. If it is between 15 and 20, 
the planet is very strong. If it is above 20, the planet is extraordinarily strong. 
 
28.5  Dwaadasa Vargeeya Bala 
 
Consider the twelve divisional charts: D-1, D-2, D- 3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-9, 
D-10, D-11, and, D-12. 
 
A planet is strong in a chart if it is in its exaltation rasi or its own rasi or a rasi owned 
by a friend. A planet is weak in a chart if it is i n its debilitation rasi or a rasi owned 
by an enemy. Out of the 12 charts above, count the charts in which a planet is strong 
and count the charts in which a planet is weak. The  difference gives 
Dwadasavargeeya 
82  bala. If a planet is strong in more charts, it is strong overall. If a 
planet is weak in more charts, it is weak overall. 
 
28.6  Lord of the Year 
 
Varsheswara or lord of the year is the most importa nt planet during the year. His 
dasa brings important results. The following are the candidates: 
 
(1)  Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the ann ual chart, based on whether 
the new year starts during the day or the night 
                                                
 
82  Dwaadasa means “twelve”. Dwaadasavargeeya means “from the 12 groups”.

(2)  Lord of natal lagna 
(3)  Lord of Muntha 
(4)  Lord of lagna in the annual chart 
(5)  Triraasi lord of lagna in the annual chart (see Table 73)

Ge Saturn Mercury 
Cn Venus Mars 
Le Jupiter Sun 
Vi Moon Venus 
Li Mercury Saturn 
Sc Mars Venus 
Sg Saturn Saturn 
Cp Mars Mars 
Aq Jupiter Jupiter 
Pi Moon Moon 
 
If a candidate is strong as per panchavargeeya bala and has a benefic aspect on lagna, 
it becomes the lord of the year. 
 
After the five candidates are found, the candidates  having a benefic aspect on lagna 
are short-listed. Out of those, the planet having t he highest panchavargeeya bala 
becomes the lord of the year. If two candidates hav e similar panchavargeeya bala, 
the one becoming a candidate in more of the five categories listed above becomes the 
lord of the year. 
 
If none of the planet has a benefic aspect on lagna , even a malefic aspect may be 
accepted. If none of the planets has an aspect on l agna, we may take a candidate that 
is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala. 
 
If none of the candidates has a strong aspect on la gna and none of the candidates is 
very strong as per panchavargeeya bala, then we may  take the first candidate (lord of 
the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the annual chart, based on whether the new year 
starts during the day or the night). 

--- Page 393 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 381  
 
 
Example 120:  Let us consider the annual chart in Example 118. L et us find the 
candidates for the lord of the year: 
 
(1)  The new year started at 4:41 am, i.e.  night time. So we should take Moon and 
find the lord of the rasi occupied by him. Moon is in Pisces owned by Jupiter. So 
Jupiter gets the first candidacy. 
(2)  Natal lagna is in Leo. So Sun gets the second candidacy. 
(3)  Muntha is in Taurus. So Venus gets the third candidacy. 
(4)  Lagna in the annual chart is in Capricorn. So Saturn gets the fourth candidacy. 
(5)  Triraasi lord for lagna in Cp at night time is Mars , from Table 73. So Mars gets 
the fifth candidacy. 
 
The candidates are – Jupiter, Sun, Venus, Saturn and Mars. Of those, Venus occupies 
lagna and Jupiter and Saturn have a square aspect o n lagna. All of them are malefic 
aspects. Sun has a semi-sextile aspect, which is ne utral. Mars has a sextile aspect on 
Capricorn lagna from Pisces. He is also has the str ongest panchavargeeya bala 
(13.7). So we conclude easily that Mars is the lord of the year. 
 
28.7  Lord of the Month 
 
We find the lord of the month in a monthly chart in  the same manner. We have six  
candidates now: 
 
(1)  Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the monthly chart, based on whether 
the new month starts during the day or the night 
(2)  Lord of natal lagna 
(3)  Lord of Muntha 
(4)  Lord of lagna in the monthly chart 
(5)  Triraasi lord of lagna in the monthly chart (see Table 73) 
(6)  Lord of the year 
 
The rest of the rules are the same.

28.8  Sahams 
 
28.8.1  Calculation 
 
Sahams are the significant points in the zodiac rel ated to specific matters. For 
example, “raajya” means kingdom and “raajya saham” is a significant point in the 
zodiac related to obtaining kingdom. “Paradesa” mea ns a foreign country and 
“paradesa saham” is a significant point in the zodi ac related to going abroad. Each 
saham has a formula that looks like A – B + C. What  this means is that we take the 
longitudes of A, B and C and find (A – B + C). This  is equivalent to finding how far 
A is from B and then taking the same distance from C. However, if C is not  between  
B and A ( i.e.  we start from B and go zodiacally till we meet A a nd we do not  find C 
on the way), then we add 30º to the value evaluated above. 
 
For example, finding (Moon – Sun + Lagna) is equiva lent to finding how far Moon 
is from  Sun and taking the same distance from  lagna. If we start from the longitude 
of Sun and go zodiacally till the longitude of Moon and do not  find lagna on the way, 
then we have to add 30º. The list of important saha ms is given in Table 74. For most 
sahams, the formula given as (A – B + C) is for day time charts. For nighttime charts, 
it changes to (B – A + C). This will not be explici tly mentioned for each saham and a 
mention will be made only when there is a difference.

 384 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Example 121: Let us consider the annual chart of Example 118 an d find artha saham 
(money), samartha saham (enterprise/ability) and vanik saham (commerce). 
 
Let us use the formulas given in Table 74. Formula of artha saham is: 2 
nd  house – 2 nd  
lord + Lagna. Because the chart is cast for the nig ht time, we should reverse the 
formula. However, as the note in parantheses after the formula says, this formula 
should be used for both day & night. Lagna is at 10  Cp 50, i.e.  280 °50'. The 2 nd  
house is at 10 Aq 50, i.e.  310 °50'. Lord of the 2 nd  house is Saturn and he is at 19 Ar 
10, i.e. 19 °10'. So artha saham = 310 °50' – 19 °10' + 280 °50' = 572 °30'. We can add 
or subtract multiples of 360º from a longitude to r educe it to the range 0º to 360º. By 
subtracting 360º, we get 212 °30'. This means that artha saham is at 212 °30'. This 
means 2 °30' in Sc or simply 2 Sc 30. Now we have to check w hether the C is 
between B and A in A – B + C. We have to check whet her lagna (280 °50') is 
between 2 nd  lord (19 °10') and 2 nd  house (310 °50'). It is – if we start from 19 °10' and 
go till 310 °50', we do encounter 280 °50' on the way. So we don’t have to add 30º. 
 
Formula of samartha saham is: Mars – Lagna Lord + L agna. Because this chart is 
cast for night time, we should make it Lagna Lord –  Mars + Lagna. Lagna lord 
Saturn is at 19 Ar 10, i.e. 19 °10'. Mars is at 24 Pi 58, i.e. 354 °58'. Lagna is at 
280 °50'. So samartha saham = 19 °10' – 354 °58' + 280 °50' + 360º. We added 360º to 
make the result positive. We can always add and sub tract multiples of 360º from any 
longitude. So samartha saham is 305 °2'. If we start from 354 °58' and go zodiacally 
till we reach 19 °10' (when we reach the end of Pisces, we go to Arie s), we do not  
encounter 280 °50'. So lagna is not  between Mars and lagna lord. So we add 30º. 
Samartha saham is finally at 335 °2', i.e.  at 5 °2' in Pi or simply 5 Pi 02. 
 
Formula of vanik saham is: Moon – Mercury + Lagna. Because this chart is cast for 
night time, we should make it Mercury – Moon + Lagn a. Moon is at 15 Pi 14, i.e. 
345 °14'. Mercury is at 11 Aq 28, i.e. 311 °28'. Lagna is at 280 °50'. So samartha 
saham = 311 °28' – 345 °14' + 280 °50'. So vanik saham is 247 °4'. If we start from 
345 °14' and go zodiacally till we reach 311 °28' (when we reach the end of Pisces, we 
go to Aries), we cover a large arc of about 330º. O n the way, we do encounter 
280 °50'. So lagna is between Moon and Mercury. So we don’t have to add 3 0º. 
Vanik saham is at 247 °4', i.e.  at 7 °4' in Sg or simply 7 Sg 04. 
 
28.8.2  Use of sahams 

--- Page 397 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 385  
 
 
If there are good yogas in an annucl chart involvin g the lord of the rasi containing an 
important saham and lagna lord, then important even ts related to the matter of the 
saham may materialize during the year. 
 
We can also use sahams in natal charts. When Saturn  or Rahu transits close to natal 
paradesa saham or jalapatana saham, for example, on e may go abroad. When Jupiter 
occupies or aspects natal vivaha saham in transit, one may get married. Thus we can 
use sahams in natal charts also. 
 
N
OTE : In western astrology, there are Arabian parts ( e.g.  part of fortune) which are 
similar to sahams. In fact, there are a lot of simi larities between the techniques in 
Tajaka system and western astrology. 
 
Some people may suggest that Indians learnt Tajaka system from Arabs. This is 
possible. However, one must note that astrology as practiced in India is much 
superior in width and depth to astrology practiced in any other part of the world. 
Indian astrology is a big superset of which different astrological traditions of the 
world are but small subsets . One may speculate that Vedic astrology as taught by 
Parasara, Jaimini, Manu etc  was very exhaustive in scope and experts in differ ent 
branches of it traveled to different parts of the w orld in ancient times to establish the 
knowledge there.

29.  Tajaka Yogas 
 
29.1  Introduction 
 
Just as we have yogas in natal charts, we have spec ial combinations with special 
results that are applicable to Tajaka annual/monthl y charts. These are called Tajaka 
yogas. These yogas are applicable to Tajaka annual charts as well as prasna charts 
(horary charts). We will briefly go over their definitions in this chapter. 
 
29.2  Definitions 
 
29.2.1  Ishkavala Yoga 
 
If planets occupy only kendras (1 
st , 4 th , 7 th  and 10 th  houses) and panapharas (2 nd , 5 th , 
8th  and 11 th  houses) and if apoklimas (3 rd , 6 th , 9 th  and 12 th  houses) are empty, then 
this yoga is present. This yoga gives wealth, happiness and good fortune. 
 
29.2.2  Induvara Yoga 
 
If planets occupy only apoklimas (3 
rd , 6 th , 9 th  and 12 th  houses) and if kendras (1 st , 4 th , 
7th  and 10 th  houses) and panapharas (2 nd , 5 th , 8 th  and 11 th  houses) are empty, then this 
yoga is present. This yoga gives disappointments, worries and illnesses. 
 
29.2.3  Ithasala Yoga 
 
If two planets have an aspect and if the faster mov ing planet 
83  is less advanced in its 
rasi than the slower moving planet, then we have an  ithasala yoga between the two. 
In western astrology, this is called an “applying aspect”. 
 
                                                
 
83  In the increasing order of speed, planets can be l isted as: Saturn, Rahu/Ketu, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, 
Venus, Mercury and Moon. 

--- Page 399 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 387  
 
Results : This is a good yoga and this shows fulfillment of  the matters represented by 
the two planets in ithasala. Suppose we want to ana lyze prospects for a particular 
matter. Then  ithasala involving lagna lord, lord o f the related house, lord of the 
related saham or the naisargika karaka (natural sig nificator) will show good results 
related to the matter. For example, ithasala betwee n lagna lord and 7 th  lord (or the 
lord of vivaha saham or Venus) shows that the native may get married in the year. 
 
Example : Suppose Moon is at 14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li. They have a sextile 
aspect. Both the planets are within the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other. Moon’s 
advancement in his rasi is 14º and Venus’s advancem ent in his rasi is 19º. Faster 
planet (Moon) is less advanced than the slower plan et (Venus). So we have ithasala 
yoga. 
 
Types of Ithasala : There are 3 types of ithasala yoga. 
 
(i) Vartamaana ithasala yoga 
 results when the planets aspect each other and both  are 
within the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other planet. Va rtamaana means present (current). 
In the above example, Venus is at 19º and his deept aamsa extends from 12º to 26º. 
Moon is within his deeptaamsa. Venus is also within  Moon’s deeptaamsa. So we 
have vartamaana ithasala. 
 
(ii ) Poorna ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other closely and their 
advancements in respective rasis are within 1º of each other. Poorna means complete. 
Poorna ithasala is the most powerful ithasala. It s hows speedy fulfillment of the 
matter. In the above example, the difference betwee n the advancements of Moon and 
Venus in respective rasis is 19º–14º = 5º. This is more than 1º. So we don’t have a 
poorna ithasala. Now let us say that Moon is at 18º 25' in Le (instead of 14 ° in Le). 
Then also we have an ithasala because Moon is behin d Venus. The difference 
between the advancements is only 0 °35', i.e.  less than 1 °. So we have a poorna 
ithasala now. 
 
(iii ) Bhavishya ithasala yoga  is formed if vartamaana ithasala yoga is about to  be 
formed when the faster moving planet moves by 1º or  less. Bhavishya means future. 
Bhavishya ithasala shows fulfillment after some obs tructions or delay. Suppose 
Moon is at 13 °35' in Le and Venus is at 21º20' in Le. There is a sextile aspect. 
Moon’s deeptaamsa is 12º and hence his sextile aspe ct on Li extends from 1º35' to 
25º35' in Li (subtract and add 12º, Moon’s deeptaam sa, from/to 13º35'). Venus is 
within Moon’s deeptaamsa. However, Moon is just outside the deeptaamsa of Venus, 

--- Page 400 ---
  
 
 388 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
as the deeptaamsa of Venus’s sextile aspect on Le extends from 14º20' to 28º20' in Li 
(subtract and add 7º, Venus’s deeptaamsa, from/to 2 1º20'). Moon is at 13 °35' and 
this is outside Venus’s deeptaamsa. So there is no vartamaana (present) ithasala. 
However, when Moon is the faster planet and he need s to move by just 0 °45' (which 
is less than 1º) to come to 14 °20'. Once he comes to 14 °20', he is within the 
deeptaamsa of Venus’s aspect on Le and we have a va rtamaana ithasala yoga. So we 
have a bhavishya (future) ithasala yoga when Moon is at 13 °35' in Le. 
 
Special Notes : One should understand the meaning of these combin ations and apply 
them intelligently. The main criterion of ithasala is that the faster moving planet 
should be behind. This means that the two planets w ill reach the same advancement 
in their rasis and have an exact  aspect (sookshma drishti) very soon. If Moon is at  
14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li, Moon is going to reach 19º very soon and Moon 
and Venus are going to have an exact sextile aspect. So the energies of Moon and 
Venus are soon going to work in unison. 
 
That is the main idea behind ithasala. If the faste r moving planet is retrograde, then 
the above is not going to happen and we no longer h ave ithasala. For example, 
suppose retrograde Mercury is at 18º in Ge and Mars  is at 18 °10' in Li. One may be 
tempted to think that there is an extremely powerfu l trinal aspect and a poorna 
ithasala yoga because the difference in advancement s is merely 0 °10'. However, that 
is not correct. Being retrograde, Mercury will go b ackward and Mars will go 
forward. They are not  going to reach the same longitude anytime soon. De spite 
indications of success, one may be dogged with failure under this combination. 
 
On the other hand, if the slower planet is retrogra de, there is no problem. It, in fact, 
shows a faster realization, as the two planets will  reach the same advancement faster. 
Suppose Moon is at 18º in Ar and retrograde Mercury  is at 24º in Ge. Now both the 
planets move towards the other planet and they are going to reach the same 
advancement soon. So there is an ithasala yoga. 
 
Suppose the faster moving planet is retrograde and it is more  advanced in its rasi 
than the slower moving planet. In that case, one ma y be tempted to think that there is 
no ithasala yoga. However, both the planets move to wards the other and so there is 
an ithasala yoga. However, a planet’s speed reduces  under retrogression and the 
difference in advancements has to be smaller. For e xample, suppose Mars is at 21º in 
Cp and retrograde Mercury is at 23º in Vi. They hav e a trinal aspect. One may be 
tempted to think that there is no ithasala here, be cause Mercury, who moves faster 

--- Page 401 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 389  
 
than Mars, is more advanced in his rasi. However, b eing retrograde, Mercury moves 
backward. Very soon, Mars and Mercury are going to have the same advancements 
in respective rasis (perhaps near 22º). They will h ave an exact aspect then. So we 
have an ithasala yoga. 
 
Thus one should adapt the rules in the case of retr ogression. Even when there is no 
retrogression, some changes may have to be made. Su ppose Mercury is at 18º in Vi 
and Mars is at 18 °45'  in Cp and neither is retrograde. Then one may be tempted to 
think that there is a poorna ithasala yoga in their  trinal aspect. Now suppose that 
Mercury is about to become retrograde and he will b ecome retrograde after reaching 
18 °05'. In that case, Mercury and Mars are not going t o have an exact  aspect anytime 
soon, because Mercury will start going backward aft er reaching 18 °05'. So there is 
no ithasala. 
 
Thus an erudite astrologer should make proper modif ications to the rules when a 
planet is retrograde or about to become retrograde. 
 
29.2.4  Eesarpha Yoga 
 
Easarpha yoga is the opposite of ithasala. If two p lanets have an aspect and the faster 
moving planet has a higher advancement in its rasi than the slower moving plan et, 
then we have eesarpha yoga. 
 
Results : This is a bad yoga. This results in failures and disappointments. If lagna lord 
has eesarpha yoga with 5 
th  lord or putra saham lord or Jupiter, some disappoi ntments 
related to children are possible. If lagna lord has an eesarpha with 10 th  lord or 5 th  lord 
or raajya saham lord or Sun in the chart of a presi dent or prime minister or king, loss 
of power is a possibility during the year. 
 
Example : Suppose Moon is at 23º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li. They have a sextile 
aspect. Both the planets are within the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other. Moon’s 
advancement in his rasi is 23º and Venus’s advancem ent in his rasi is 19º. Faster 
planet (Moon) is more advanced than the slower plan et (Venus). So we have 
eesarpha yoga. 
 
Special Notes : We made some comments under ithasala yoga about p lanets that are 
retrograde or about to become retrograde. If the fa ster moving planet is retrograde 
and less advanced in its rasi, then we have eesaarp ha yoga. If the faster moving 

--- Page 402 ---
  
 
 390 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
planet in an aspect is retrograde and more advanced  in its rasi, then we do not have 
eesarpha yoga. We have an ithasala yoga instead. 
 
29.2.5  Nakta Yoga 
 
Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no  ithasala yoga or eesarpha yoga. 
Then, we say that there is Nakta yoga between the t wo planets, if a planet that moves 
faster than both the planets has an aspect with bot h and forms ithasala yoga with 
both. This shows fulfillment of the matters represe nted by the first 2 planets with the 
help of someone shows by the 3 
rd  planet. 
 
Example : Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13º in Ge.  Suppose 7 
th  lord Mars is 
in Sc (7 th  itself) at 15º. They have no aspect. Now suppose M oon is at 11º in Cn. He 
has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal a spect with Mars. He has a lower 
advancement in his rasi (11º) than the other two pl anets and hence he has an ithasala 
yoga with the two planets. Thus, Venus and Mars hav e Nakta yoga between them. 
Because Venus is lagna lord in 2 nd  (family) and Mars is the 7 th  lord in 7 th , this yoga 
shows getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone shown 
by Moon. As Moon owns the 3 rd  house, this may show the involvement of younger 
brother or sister. For example, the native may marr y a friend of his younger sister 
with her help. 
 
29.2.6  Yamaya Yoga 
 
Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no  ithasala yoga or eesarpha yoga. 
Then, we say that there is Yamaya yoga between the two planets, if a planet that 
moves slower than both the planets has an aspect wi th both and forms ithasala yoga 
with both. This shows fulfillment of the matters re presented by the first 2 planets 
with the help of someone shows by the 3 
rd  planet, after obstacles and delays. 
 
Example : Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13º in Ge.  Suppose 7 
th  lord Mars is 
in Sc (7 th  itself) at 15º. They have no aspect. Now suppose J upiter is at 16º in Cn. He 
has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal a spect with Mars. He has a higher 
advancement in his rasi (16º) than the other two pl anets and hence he has an ithasala 
yoga with the two planets. Thus, Venus and Mars hav e Yamaya yoga between them. 
Because Venus is lagna lord in 2 nd  (family) and Mars is the 7 th  lord in 7 th , this yoga 
shows getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone shown 

--- Page 403 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 391  
 
by Jupiter. As Jupiter owns the 11 th  house, this may show the involvement of elder 
siblings or friends. 
 
29.2.7  Manahoo Yoga 
 
Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Satur n or Mars is in conjunction with 
the faster moving planet and stays within the deept aamsa of the latter, then Manahoo 
yoga results. This yoga cancels the ithasala yoga a nd gives failures, disappointments, 
quarrels, loss of wealth etc . 
 
Suppose Jupiter is at 21º in Pi and Moon is at 18º in Cn, then they have a sextile 
aspect and an ithasala yoga, because Moon (18º) is behind Jupiter (21º). However, let 
us say that Saturn is at 19º in Cn. Then Saturn can cels the ithasala between Moon 
and Jupiter and gives bad results. 
 
If Mars or Saturn is one of the two planets in itha sala yoga, then we obviously need 
the other planet to give Manahoo yoga. 
 
Notes : Some people suggest that an aspect of Saturn or M ars within the deeptaamsa 
of the faster moving planet is sufficient to give M anahoo yoga. In the above 
example, Saturn need not be in Cn according to this . Saturn or Mars in 6º-30º 
(Moon’s deeptaamsa) in Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Cp, Pi, Ar, Ta and Ge will have an aspect 
with Moon – faster moving planet in Moon-Jupiter it hasala – within Moon’s 
deeptaamsa. So Manahoo yoga results. However, reade rs are advised to consider 
only conjunction. Some authors have suggested that both Mars and Saturn must be 
involved, but one of them is enough to spoil ithasala yoga and give Manahoo yoga. 
 
29.2.8  Kamboola Yoga 
 
Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Moon has an ithasala with one of the 
planets (or both), then we have Kamboola yoga. This yoga adds power to the ithasala 
yoga. The power added varies based on the strength of Moon and other planets. 
 
Suppose Mars is at 23º in Sc and Jupiter is at 26º in Pi. Then they have a trinal aspect 
and an ithasala yoga. Now, suppose Moon is at 22º i n Le. He has an ithasala yoga 
with Mars. So we have Kamboola yoga and Mars-Jupite r ithasala becomes more 
powerful because of it. 

--- Page 404 ---
  
 
 392 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
29.2.9  Gairi-Kamboola Yoga 
 
If Moon is in the last degree of a rasi and he will  form ithasala with one of the 
planets in an ithasala after moving to the next ras i, it is called Gairi-Kamboola yoga. 
It is essentially Kamboola yoga in waiting. Moon mu st also form an ithasala with a 
strong planet for this yoga to be effective. Moreov er, Moon should not be exalted or 
debilitated or occupy his own navamsa, drekkana or hadda. This yoga shows 
realization of the matter with help from others, after some delay. 
 
Suppose Mars is at 1º in Cp, Jupiter is at 2º in Pi  and Venus is at 3 ° in Li. Mars and 
Jupiter have a sextile aspect and ithasala yoga. Su ppose Moon is at 29 °10' in Vi. 
Moon is in the last degree of Vi. Moon is in Mercur y’s navamsa (Vi), Venus’s 
drekkana (Ta) and Saturn’s hadda. Moon has no ithas ala with Mars or Jupiter, but he 
will have ithasala with Mars as soon as he moves to  Li. He also has ithasala with 
Venus, who is very strong. So we have Gairi-Kamboola yoga. 
 
29.2.10  Khallasara Yoga 
 
If lagna lord is in the rasi between Moon and anoth er planet X without ithasala with 
either planet, then Khallasara yoga results. This yoga destroys the signification of X. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Vi, Moon is at 1º in Ar, lagna lord Mercury is at 15º in Ta and 
Jupiter is at 29º in Ge, then Khallasara yoga is fo rmed. Lagna lord Mercury is 
between Moon and Jupiter and there is no ithasala w ith Moon or Jupiter. The 
significations of Jupiter are destroyed and there m ay be some disappointments 
related to mother, education, house, vehicles or marriage. 
 
29.2.11  Radda Yoga 
 
If an ithasala yoga involves a planet in debilitati on or retrogression or combustion or 
otherwise weak, it turns into Radda yoga. This yoga  negates ithasala and gives bad 
results. 
 
About planets in retrogression, one should remember  the comments made under 
ithasala yoga. If retrograde Mercury is at 5º in Vi  and Mars is at 7º in Sc, there is no 

--- Page 405 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 393  
 
ithasala. Whether one calls it Eesarpha or Radda yo ga depends on one’s 
interpretation, but the results are going to be bad in either case. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ar, Saturn is at 20º in Ar and Mars is at 15º in Sg. Then they 
have an ithasala yoga. However, Saturn is debilitat ed. So ithasala turns into radda 
and bad results are indicated. Because Saturn owns the 10 
th  and 11 th  houses, they can 
be related to career and material gains. 
 
29.2.12  Duhphali-Kutta Yoga 
 
If ( a) the faster planet in an ithasala is exalted or oc cupies own rasi or has a good 
panchavargeeya bala and ( b) the slower planet is not exalted, not in own rasi  and 
weak in panchavargeeya bala, then it goes by a spec ial name – Duhphali-Kutta yoga. 
This yoga shows realization of ambitions and dreams. 
 
Suppose Saturn is at 20º in Li with a good panchava rgeeya bala and Mars is at 18º in 
Ge with a low panchavargeeya bala, then they have a n ithasala yoga. Because 
Saturn, the slower planet, is exalted and strong an d Mars, the faster planet, is weak, 
this becomes Duhphali-Kutta yoga. 
 
29.2.13  Duttota Yoga 
 
If two planets in an ithasala are weak (debilitated  or occupying inimical rasis, having 
a low panchavargeeya bala) and one of them has an i thasala yoga with a strong 
planet (exalted or occupying own rasi, having a hig h panchavargeeya bala), then we 
have Duttota yoga. 
 
This yoga gives good results. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ar, Saturn is at 20º in Ar and Mars is at 19º in Li. Then they 
have an ithasala yoga. However, Saturn is debilitat ed. So ithasala turns into radda 
and bad results are indicated. Now, suppose Venus i s at 18º in Pi. Saturn has a semi-
sextile aspect and an ithasala yoga with exalted Ve nus. So the final result is Duttota 
yoga and good results are promised. Because Saturn owns the 10 
th  and 11 th  houses, 
they can be related to career and material gains. 
 
29.2.14  Thambira Yoga 

--- Page 406 ---
  
 
 394 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
If a planet is in the last degree of a rasi and it forms ithasala yoga after moving to the 
next rasi with a slower moving planet, it is called  Thambira yoga. This shows 
realization of hopes after delay and hard work. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ar, Mars is at 2º in Le and Ven us is at 29 °10' in Ta. Venus has 
no ithasala with Mars. However, when Venus moves to  Ge, he will have an ithasala 
with Mars. So Venus forms Thambira yoga with Mars. This shows good events 
related to family and marital life after some hard work. 
 
29.2.15  Kutta Yoga 
 
If a planet occupying lagna is aspected by a planet  in occupying own or exaltation 
rasi in a kendra or a panaphara, then this yoga is formed. The desires related to the 
matters signified by the planet in lagna are fulfilled. 
84  
 
Suppose lagna is in Ta, Sun is at 21º in Ta and Mer cury is at 16º in Vi. Mercury is 
exalted in a panaphara and aspects Sun in lagna. So  Sun gives Kutta yoga and the 4 
th  
house matters receive a boost in the year. 
 
29.2.16  Durupha Yoga 
 
Ithasala given by two planets in dusthanas (6 
th , 8 th  and 12 th  house) in combustion or 
retrogression or debilitation turns into Durupha yo ga. The planets are powerless to 
give any good results. 
 
Suppose lagna is in Ar. Suppose Mars is at 15º in C n and Saturn is at 17º in Ar. 
Because both Mars and Saturn are debilitated, their ithasala turns into Durupha yoga. 
Mars and Saturn cannot give good results related to career and gains. 
 
29.3  Conclusion 
 
One should remember the definitions of all the yogas and consider all of them. There 
is some overlap between some yogas here. An ithasal a may be converted to another 
                                                
 
84  This yoga was interpreted differently by scholars. 

--- Page 407 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 395  
 
yoga if an additional combination is present and it  may again turn into another yoga 
under yet another combination. So it is possible to  overlook one planet and conclude 
the presence of a wrong yoga.

30.  Annual Dasas 
 
30.1  Introduction 
 
We have studied different dasa systems that enable us to time events in a person’s 
life. In the previous few chapters, we have seen ho w Tajaka annual charts show the 
fortune in a one-year period. The next question is – how do we time events shown in 
a Tajaka annual chart? For example, an annual chart  may show that the native will 
get married in the year. The question is – when in the year will (s)he get married? 
 
All the dasas covered earlier are valid for natal c harts and their paramayush is of the 
order of 100 years. On the other hand, an annual ch art applies only for a period of 
one year. So we need dasas that are compressed to a one-year period. We will learn 3 
dasas in this chapter: (1) Patyayini dasa 
85  mentioned by Tajaka writers, (2) Mudda 
dasa or Varsha Vimsottari dasa, and, (3) Varsha Narayana dasa. 
 
In Vimsottari dasa and Narayana dasa, paramayush of  120 years is compressed to 
one year. One may try finding compressed Vimsottari  dasa based on Moon’s 
constellation in the annual chart, but the best res ults are obtained by progressing 
Moon’s constellation in the natal chart at the rate  of one constellation per year and 
using it to initiate dasas. Similarly, one may try finding compressed Narayana dasa 
based on lagna in the annual chart, but the best re sults are obtained by progressing 
lagna in the natal chart at the rate of one sign pe r year and using it as lagna for the 
purpose of Narayana dasa 
86 . 
 
Example 122: Let us consider a lady born on 1 
st  June 1972 at 4:16 am (IST) at 81 E 
12, 16 N 15. She got married on 24 th  July 1993. Let us time this event from 1993-94 
annual chart using all the 3 dasas. 
 
Varsha pravesh data:  1 
st  June 1993, 1:30:04 pm (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15. Ras i and 
navamsa charts of this data are given in Chart 67. 
                                                
 
85  Dr. B.V. Raman simply called this “Varsha dasa” (a nnual dasa). 
86  This is a result of the author’s own researches.

Venus in the 2 nd  house of family. All these factors brought marriag e in the year. We 
will time it using different dasas now. 
30.2  Patyayini Dasa 
 
This dasa is based on the longitudes of lagna and a ll planets and it is specifically 
meant for Tajaka charts. 
 
Procedure: 
 
(1)  Consider lagna and the seven planets. Find their advancement from the beginning 
of the respective signs occupied by them. Arrange t hem in the ascending order. 
These are called “Krisamsas” of planets. 
(2)  Leave the krisamsa of the first planet (the one wit h the lowest value). From 
krisamsas of all other planets, subtract the krisam sas of the previous planets. In 
other words, subtract the krisamsa that is just bel ow the current planet’s 
krisamsa. These values are called “Patyamsas”. 
(3)  Dasas of lagna and the seven planet are in the orde r found in (1). Their dasas are 
in the ratio of their patyamsas. Dasa of a planet (in days) is given by the formula: 
365.2425 
x (its patyamsa / sum of all patyamsas 87 ) 
(4)  To find antardasas, we use the same ratios and orde r used in dasas, just as in 
Vimsottari dasa. First antardasa is the same as dasa. Then we go in the order.  
For the annual chart in Example 122, we can find th e longitudes of planets and lagna 
in Chart 67. We can arange them in the ascending or der and find the ratios as shown 
in Table 75. 
 
We see that the first 25 days (June 1-26, 1993) is Venus dasa. Next 48 days (June 26-
Aug 13, 1993) is Mercury dasa. And so on. 
 
The first antardasa in Venus dasa belongs to Venus himself. Its length is 0.0684 x 
24.98 days = 1.7 days. Next antardasa belongs to Me rcury and the length is 0.1319 x 
24.98 = 3.3 days. Next antardasa belongs to Moon an d the length is 0.0014 x 24.98 = 
0.03 days ( i.e.  less than an hour). Next antardasa belongs to Satu rn and the length is 
                                                
 
87  It may be noted that the sum of all patyamsas is nothing but the largest krisamsa. 

--- Page 411 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 399  
 
0.0705 x 24.98 = 1.8 days. We can find all the antardasas i n all the dasas in this 
manner. 
Table 75: Patyayini Dasa Calculation 
Planet Krisamsa Patyamsa Fraction Days 
Venus 1° 38' 1 ° 38' 1 ° 38'/23 ° 53' =  0.0684 24.98 
Mercury 4° 47' 3 ° 9' 3 ° 9'/23 ° 53' =  0.1319 48.17 
Moon 4° 49' 0 ° 2' 0 ° 2'/23 ° 53' =  0.0014 0.51 
Saturn 6° 30' 1 ° 41' 1 ° 41'/23 ° 53' =  0.0705 25.74 
Lagna 7° 14' 0 ° 44' 0 ° 44'/23 ° 53' =  0.0307 11.21 
Jupiter 10 ° 59' 3 ° 45' 3 ° 45'/23 ° 53' =  0.1570 57.35 
Sun 17 ° 5' 6 ° 6' 6 ° 6'/23 ° 53' =  0.2554 93.29 
Mars 23 ° 53' 6 ° 48' 6 ° 48'/23 ° 53' =  0.2847 103.99 
 
Timing of marriage: 
 
Mercury dasa ran during June 26-Aug 13, 1993. This was the dasa that was running 
when she got married on 24 
th  July 1993. Why did Mercury give marriage? 
 
(1)  Mercury is lagna lord. 
(2)  He is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala. 
(3)  He is varsheswara (lord of the year). 
(4)  He aspects vivaha saham within 3º. 
(5)  In navamsa, which is the right chart for marriage, he is the 7 
th  lord. He is strong 
in a trine. Lagna and 7 th  lords in navamsa can certainly give marriage. 
 
30.3  Mudda Dasa (Varsha Vimsottari Dasa) 
 
Dasa length: 
 
This is essentially Vimsottari dasa with 120 years compressed to a solar year. If we 
take a solar year to be of 360 days, with each day corresponding to the time period in 
which Sun moves by exactly 1º, we get the dasa of d ays of a planet by multiplying 
normal dasa years by 3. For example, Sun dasa is no rmally for 6 years. By 
compressing 120 years to 360 solar days, we find Sun’s Varsha Vimsottari dasa to be 
6 
x 3 = 18 days. Durations of all dasas are given in Table 76 (in solar days). 

--- Page 412 ---
  
 
 400 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Table 76: Varsha Vimsottari Dasa Days 
Planet  Sun  Moon  Mars  Rahu Jupiter Saturn Mercury Ketu Venus  
Days 18 30 21 54 48 57 51 21 60 
 
Dasa order: 
 
To initiate dasas, we should progress Moon’s natal constellation at the rate of one 
constellation per year and use the resulting conste llation. Instead of progressing the 
constellation, we can also do the following: 
 
Consider (1) Sun, (2) Moon, (3) Mars, (4) Rahu, (5)  Jupiter, (6) Saturn, (7) Mercury, 
(8) Ketu and (9) Venus. 
 
Take the number corresponding to the lord of Moon’s  natal constellation ( i.e.  the 
lord of the first Vimsottari dasa in natal chart). Add the number of completed  years 
to this number. Divide the number by 9 and take the  remainder. See the planet 
corresponding to that number. First dasa belongs to  that planet. After that, dasas will 
follow the normal order. Remainder of 0 is equivalent to 9 and hence shows Venus. 
 
In Example 122, natal Moon is in Uttaraashaadha con stellation. So the first dasa 
belongs to Sun. The number corresponding to Sun is 1. Number of completed years 
is 1993-1972=21. Adding 1 and 21, we get 22. Dividi ng it by 9, we get a quotient of 
2 and a remainder of 4. That shows Rahu. 
 
Dasa balance: 
 
For finding the dasa balance, the fraction of the n atal Moon’s constellation yet to be 
traversed is taken. 
 
In Example 122, natal Moon is at 29 Sg 28. About 0. 79 of the constellation is yet to 
be traversed by natal Moon. So the balance in Rahu’ s Varsha Vimsottari dasa of 
1994-94 is 0.79 
x 54 solar days = 42.66 solar days. So June 1-July 1 4, 1993 is Rahu 
dasa. Jupiter dasa runs for 48 days then. 
 
Timing of marriage: 
 

--- Page 413 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 401  
 
Jupiter is 7 th  lord and vivaha saham lord in rasi chart. He is in  lagna. In navamsa, he 
is lagna lord and occupies the 2 nd  house of family with Venus. 
 
It may, however, be noted that Mercury is a better candidate for giving marriage, for 
the reasons mentioned earlier. Patyayini dasa shows  the event better than Mudda 
dasa. 
 
30.4  Varsha Narayana Dasa 
 
Dasa durations: 
 
This is essentially Narayana dasa compressed from 120 years 
88  to 360 solar days. If a 
rasi’s dasa is of n years, it becomes 3 x n solar days after compression, i.e.  a period in 
which Sun moves by (3 x n)º. 
 
Dasa order: 
 
We find the dasa order in Narayana dasa of rasi cha rt and Narayana dasa of 
divisional charts just as in natal charts. The only  difference is that we should 
progress natal lagna and use it, instead of lagna in the annual chart. 
 
Just as we progress Moon by one constellation per y ear when finding Varsha 
Vimsottari dasa, we progress lagna by one rasi per year when finding Varsha 
Narayana dasa. In other words, we take muntha as la gna when finding Varsha 
Narayana dasa. This is the link between the natal chart and the Tajaka chart. 
 
Let us take Example 122 and find Varsha Narayana da sa of D-9. Natal lagna is in 
Aries. Because the native started the 22 
nd year in 1993, we find the 22 nd  house, i.e.  
the 10 th  house (after removing 12), from Ar and get muntha in Cp. 
 
We now find Varsha Narayana dasa assuming that lagn a in rasi chart is in Cp. To 
find Narayana dasa of D-9, we need the 9 
th  lord in rasi chart. Vi is the 9 th  from Cp 
and Mercury owns it. He is in Sc in navamsa and Sc is stronger than Ta. So we start 
dasas from Sc. Normally the dasa order should have been Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li etc . 
                                                 
88  Sum of the 2 cycles of Narayana dasa for natal cha rts is 12 x 12 = 144 years. However, only the 
first 120 years of this is valid, as the paramayush of human beings is 120 years.

But Saturn is in Sc and the “Saturn exception” appl ies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp, 
Aq, Pi, Ar etc . 
 
Sc, Sg, Cp and Aq dasas are of 7, 4, 2 and 3 years respectively. After compressing to 
one year, they are of 21, 12, 6 and 9 solar days re spectively. This covers 48 solar 
days and these dasas run from June 1-July 20, 1993.  Pisces dasa of 33 days started 
then and it brought marriage. 
 
Why Pisces dasa? Well, it contains lagna in D-9 and  has subhaargala from lagna lord 
Jupiter and Venus. Navamsa lagna’s dasa as per Varsha Narayana dasa of navamsa is 
an ideal candidate for bringing marriage. 
 
Exercise 48: A native born on 4 
th  April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at 81 E 12, 16 N 15 
got married on 1 st  August 1993. Verify that navamsa lagna’s dasa as p er varsha 
Narayana dasa of navamsa was running at the time of  marriage. Verify that the 
running dasa and antardasa as per Patyayini dasa an d Mudda dasa – at the time of 
wedding – belonged to lagna/7 th  lord in rasi/navamsa. 
 
Usually Patyayini dasa gives better results than Mu dda dasa. Varsha Narayana dasa 
is, however, the best dasa for Tajaka annual charts . So we will see more examples of 
Varsha Narayana dasa. 
 
Example 123:  The native of Exercise 48 went from India to US fo r his masters 
degree in engineering, on 15 
th  August 1991. He went on a fellowship from a 
University in US. Let us time his foreign trip using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-4. 
 
Varsha pravesh data: 5 
th  April 1991, 3:05:33 am (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15 
 
In rasi chart, lagna has Saturn and Rahu. Both the planets show living away from the 
place of birth. Jupiter owns 12 
th  – living away from homeland – and he is exalted in  
7th  – a long trip. In D-4 (see Chart 68), 9 th  and 12 th  lord Mercury is in 7 th  showing a 
long trip to a foreign land. Mars owns 7 th  (long trips) and he is in 9 th . Sun owns 
paradesa saham and jalapatana saham and he is in 12 th  – foreign lands – in D-4. For 
all these reasons, the native went abroad during the year.

 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 403  
 
Chart 68 
 
 
Though rasi chart has lagna in Cp, muntha or annual  progressed ascendant is in Ge. 
We should use Ge as lagna for Varsha Narayana dasa.  The 4 
th  house from Ge is Vi 
and Mercury owns it. He is in Ar in D-4. Ar with tw o planets is stronger than Li with 
one planet. Dasas go as Ar, Ta, Ge Cn etc . 
 
Virgo dasa was running during August 10-26, 1991. T he native went abroad on 
15 
th /16 th  August 1991, during Virgo dasa, Gemini antardasa a s per Varsha Narayana 
dasa of D-4. Virgo is the 12 th  house containing the lord of padesa saham and 
jalapatana saham. Gemini is the 9 th  house containing 7 th  lord. Lord of both Virgo and 
Gemini is Mercury and he is in the 7 th  house. 
 
Example 124:  The native of Exercise 48 stood State First in Int ermediate 
(Secondary School) examinations in the AP state of India on 28 
th  May 1987 and he 
was selected for Indian Institute of Technology (In dia’s top engineering school) on 
1st  June 1987. Let us time this academic success using  Varsha Narayana dasa of D-
24.

Vidya saham lord Mars is in the 5 
th  house in rasi chart. He is in own sign in D-24, 
which shows education (see Chart 69). He is in the 3rd  house from AL in D-24, 
showing material success (in education, as this is in D-24). 
 
Chart 69 
 
 
Muntha is in Aq in rasi chart. Taking Aq as lagna, 12 
th  house is Cp. Its lord is Saturn. 
He is in Ar in D-24 and Ar is stronger than Li. So Varsha Narayana dasa of D-24 
goes as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc . Cn dasa runs during May 26-June 17, 1987. This da sa 
brought academic success. Why? 
 
(1)  Cn contains lagna lord and shows prosperity to the matters signified by the chart, 
i.e.  education. 
(2)  It is the 11 
th  from AL and shows gains in status (of course, only  in the field of 
education). 
(3)  Its lord Moon is in the 5 th  house from it. 
(4)  The 5 th  house from it has a very strong Mars, who is in ow n sign. Moreover, 
Mars owns vidya saham and occupies 5 th  in rasi chart.

Example 125: The native of Exercise 48 had a son on 21 
st  August 1998. Let us time 
this using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-7.

Chart 70 
 
 
In rasi chart, lagna is in Sc and putra saham is in  Ar. Lord Mars is in 5 
th  house. D-7 
shows children. In D-7, Jupiter owns 5 th  and he aspects 5 th  from 11 th  (see Chart 70). 
This resulted in a son in the year. 
 
Muntha is in Cp in rasi chart. The 7 
th  house is in Cn. Moon owns it. Moon is in Cp in 
D-7 and Cp is stronger than Cn. So Narayana dasa of  D-7 starts from Cp and goes as 
Cp, Sg, Sc, Li etc . 
 
Ge dasa of 24 solar days started just before the bi rth of son. Why did Ge give a child 
in its D-7 Varsha Narayana dasa? 
 

--- Page 418 ---
  
 
 406 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
(1)  Ge is the 11 th  house in D-7, showing happiness related to children. 
(2)  Ge has Jupiter, the significator of children. 
(3)  Ge has Jupiter, the 5 th  lord who aspects 5 th . 
(4)  The 3 rd  house is the 11 th  from 5 th  and shows childbirth. Its exalted lord Venus 
aspects Ge. 
(5)  Mars owns putra saham and he aspects Ge. 
(6)  Putra pada (arudha pada of 5th) aspects Ge from Vi. 
 
Gemini is a clear candidate simply because it is 11
th  and 5 th  lord Jupiter occupies it. 
 
Exercise 49:  Given that the native of Exercise 48 bought a car in 1995-96, try to 
time it using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-16. 
 
30.5  Conclusion 
 
In this chapter, we learnt three dasa systems that are applicable to Tajaka annual 
charts. Patyayini dasa is applicable to Tajaka mont hly charts also. For annual charts, 
Varsha Narayana dasa and Patyayini dasa give the be st results. If a result seems 
likely in an annual chart, we can find the exact mo nth or week of the event using 
these dasas.

Chart 71 
 
 
Look at D-16 of the annual chart. The 4 
th  from lagna is not strong. If the native 
bought a vehicle, it must be due to the strength of the 4 th  from Venus. Exalted Jupiter 
is in the 4 th  from Venus. Jupiter owns 3 rd  and shows expenditure on 4 th , i.e.  
expenditure on account of happiness from vehicle. H e is exalted in the 4 th  from 
Venus showing a good vehicle. Muntha is in Li and Cp is the 4 th . Saturns owns it and 
occupies Vi in D-16. Pi is stronger than Vi. So dasas go as Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le etc . 
 
Cancer dasa in the second cycle ran during Jan 16-F eb 9, 1996. The native bought a 
car in this dasa.

31.  Sudarsana Chakra Dasa 
 
31.1  Introduction 
 
Parasara said that Sudarsana Chakra dasa was taught  by Brahma – the Creator – 
Himself and that it is a great tool for predicting daily, monthly and annual fortune. 
Because the calculations necessary for Sudarsana Ch akra dasa interpretation are an 
integral part of casting Tajaka annual, monthly and  sixty-hour charts, this dasa is 
being covered in the part on “Tajaka Analysis” rath er than the part on “Dasa 
Analysis”. However, it should be borne in mind that  this is a dasa applicable to natal 
charts. This is just a natal dasa like Vimsottari d asa, Narayana dasa and Kalachakra 
dasa. 
 
Chart 72 
 
 

--- Page 421 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 409  
 
31.2  Sudarsana Chakra 
 
In each chart, there are 3 important reference poin ts: (1) lagna, (2) Moon, and, (3) 
Sun. Lagna represents the physical body. Moon repre sents the mind. Sun represents 
the soul. The three together represent one’s self. We should consider houses from all 
the three reference points when judging a chart. Fo r example, we need to look at the 
10 
th  house from lagna, Moon and Sun to see career. Thou gh we typically give 
importance to lagna, all the three references are important. 
 
To symbolically represent this, we can draw Sudarsa na Chakra (SC) as taught by 
Parasara. We should draw 3 concentric circles. We s hould write down the bhava 
chakra with respect to lagna, Moon and Sun in the i nner, middle and outer charts. To 
illustrate this, let us take the rasi chart given i n Chart 72. Sudarsana Chakra for this 
chart is given in Figure 4. 
 
The 10 
th  house from lagna is in Sg and it has Ketu. The 10 th  house from Moon is Sc 
and it is empty. The 10 th  house from Sun is Aries and it is empty. We should  analyze 
all the 3 factors together to draw conclusions. 
 
31.3  Dasa Computation 
 
Dasas of the 12 houses run in cycles throughout a n ative’s life. Each dasa is for one 
year. For example, dasa of the 1 
st  house runs in the 1 st  year of one’s life. Dasa of the 
2nd  house runs in the 2 nd  year of one’s life. After 12 years, dasa of the 1 st  house will 
return in the 13 th  year. Dasa of the 2 nd  house will return in the 14 th  year. After every 
12 years, the same dasas keep coming. 
 
One year stands for a solar year here. A new dasa s tarts after every one year. The 
exact date and time when a new SC dasa starts can b e found by casting Tajaka 
annual chart. Look at the number of years completed . Adding one to it, you get the 
year that starts. Divide it by 12 and find the rema inder (if the remainder is zero, 
make it 12). This remainder gives the house whose dasa runs in the year. 
 
For example, let us take a native who finishes 44 y ears and starts the 45 
th  year of his 
life on a particular date. Because the remainder wh en 45 is divided by 12 is 9, SC 
dasa of the 9 th  house runs in the 45 th  year. 

--- Page 422 ---
  
 
 410 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
When we say dasa of the 9 
th  house here, we mean the 9 th  house from lagna, Moon 
and Sun. If lagna is in Pi, Moon is in Aq and Sun i s in Cn, then the 9 th  house is in Sc, 
Li and Pi. 
 
However, analyzing with 3 signs becomes difficult. So one may conveniently choose 
the strongest reference out of lagna, Moon and Sun and take dasas from it. This is 
only an approximation, but it simplifies analysis. 
 
Figure 4: Sudarsana Chakra 
 
 
 

--- Page 423 ---
 
 
 Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 411  
 
Antardasas: 
 
Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. Take the d asa sign as lagna and give the 1 
st , 
2nd , 3 rd  etc  houses from it to antardasas. 
 
If Pi is natal lagna, dasa in the 45 
th  year belongs to the 9 th  house, i.e.  Sc. Antardasas 
in this dasa go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc . 
 
We can use Tajaka monthly charts to find the date and time when an antardasa starts. 
 
Similarly, we can find pratyantardasas from antarda sas and use Tajaka sixty-hour 
charts to find the date and time when a pratyantardasa starts. 
 
In short, Tajaka annual, monthly and sixty-hour cha rts are nothing but the entry 
charts of dasas, antardasas and pratyantardasas as per Sud arsana Chakra dasa. 
Muntha in Tajaka annual charts is nothing but the d asa sign as per Sudarsana Chakra 
dasa, but always reckoned from lagna. If we redefin e muntha to be the progressed 
from the strongest of lagna, Moon and Sun (instead of always from lagna), it exactly 
becomes the SC dasa sign. 
 
We can find Sudarsana Chakra dasa for divisional ch arts also. We take the strongest 
of lagna, Moon and Sun and then start SC dasa from there. It moves at the rate of one 
house per year. Examples will make this clear. 
 
31.4  Dasa Interpretation 
 
To interpret a dasa (or antardasa or pratyantardasa ), we have to take the dasa sign (or 
antardasa sign or pratyantardasa sign) as lagna and  analyze the planetary positions 
with respect to it. What planetary positions do we mean – natal or transit? 
 
Some people may prefer to analyze the natal positio ns, but that would suggest that 
one gets the same results after every 12 years. That is not logical. 
 
Parasara clearly advised that we have to analyze th e planetary positions at the 
commencement of a dasa (or antardasa or pratyantardasa) with res pect to the dasa 
sign (or antardasa sign or pratyantardasa sign). This is where Tajaka charts fit in.

 412 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
If benefics are in quadrants, trines and 8 th  from dasa sign, favorable results can be 
expected. Benefics in houses other than the 6 th  and 12 th  houses produce good results 
for the houses they occupy. Malefics in the 3 rd , 6 th  and 11 th  houses bring good results. 
Malefics in other houses spoil the results of the h ouses they occupy. In particular, 
Rahu destroys the house he occupies. 
 
Example 126: Let us revisit Example 124. In the natal chart, la gna and Moon are in 
Ge in D-24. In 1987-88, the native ran the 18 
th  year of his life. So SC dasa of the 6 th  
house was running. The 6 th  house from Ge is Sc. So Scorpio dasa was running a s per 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa of D-24. We should look at pl anetary positions w.r.t. Sc at 
the time this dasa started, i.e.  in Tajaka annual chart of the year (see Chart 69). 
 
Benefics Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are in 5 
th , 8 th  and 9 th  respectively and all of 
them are good placements. Malefics Saturn, Rahu and  Ketu are in 6 th , 11 th  and 11 th  
respectively and all of them are good placements. M oreover, dasa sign Sc houses a 
powerful raja yoga involving the 1 st , 9 th  and 10 th  lords from it. 
 
For all these reasons, this year was excellent for matters shown in D-24. 
 
Though Sudarsana Chakra dasa can be found for all d ivisional charts, pay special 
attention to rasi chart. Here is an example. 
 
Example 127: Indira Gandhi’s natal rasi chart and Tajaka annual  chart of 1976-77 
are given in Chart 73. During that year, Indira Gan dhi’s party lost the Parliamentary 
Elections and she was removed from the post of India’s Prime Minister. 
 
Because the finished years are 1976-1917 = 59, we s hould add 1 and divide 60 by 
12. Remainder is 12 and Sudarsana Chakra dasa durin g the year belongs to the 12 
th  
house. Compared to lagna and Moon, Sun with Budha-A aditya yoga is stronger. Let 
us take the 12 th  from Sun. It is Libra. 
 
Libra’s SC dasa runs during the year and we should look at the planetary positions 
from Libra in the Tajaka annual chart (or dasa comm encement chart). Benefic Venus 
is in 3 
rd  giving failures. Rahu afflicts the 1 st  house. Mars, Sun and Mercury are not 
well-placed in the 2 nd  house. Saturn afflicts the 10 th  house showing troubles in 
career.

 414 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Because of bad placement of planets (especially Sat urn and Rahu), Sudarsana 
Chakra does not promise a good year. No wonder Mrs. Gandhi fell from power. 
 
Example 128:  Let us consider the lady of Chart 74. She got marr ied in January 
1999. Let us analyze her Sudarsana Chakra dasa of navamsa for 1998-99. 
 
She was born in 1973 and she started her 26 
th  year in July 1998. If we divide 26 by 
12, we get a remainder of 2. So SC dasa in 1998-99 belongs to the 2 nd  house. In natal 
navamsa, lagna is in Cn and it is stronger than Moo n and Sun. The 2 nd  house from 
Cn is Le. So Le dasa was running in 1998-99. Is it a good dasa? 
 
Three benefics are in quadrants and 3 malefics are in 3 
rd /11 th . Though Mars is in 9 th , 
he is strong being in own house. Most planets are f avorably placed and, more 
importantly, lagna and 7 th  are strong with Jupiter and Venus in them (respect ively). 
So this was a favorable year for matters shown by D-9. No wonder she got married. 
 
31.5  Conclusion 
 
Parasara called Sudarsana Chakra dasa a very import ant dasa. It, however, needs to 
be understood better. 
 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa is interpreted based on the p lanetary positions at the 
commencement of a dasa or an antardasa or a pratyan tardasa. Those planetary 
positions can be found from Tajaka annual or monthl y or sixty-hour charts. In 
addition, muntha defined in Tajaka texts is nothing  but Sudarsana Chakra dasa rasi 
reckoned from lagna. So there may be some missing l inks between Sudarsana 
Chakra dasa and Tajaka analysis. 
 
Sudarsana chakra dasa is good at showing favorable and unfavorable periods in a 
general sense.

Part 5:  Special Topics 
 
 
 
Some speical topics will be covered in this part. 
 
When one uses Vedic astrology at its fullest glory,  it is very 
systematic and leads to very precise predictions. H owever, we 
need a very accurate birthtime. In real life, howev er, we often 
get erroneous data. Coping with birthtime errors is  a very 
important topic. 
 
In an effort to promote rational thinking in the as trological 
community, a chapter on rational thinking is included. 
 
What is the use of diagnosing one’s disease, if the  diease 
cannot be remedied? Similarly, what is the use of m aking 
intelligent guesses about future, if we cannot do s omething 
about undesirable events that are likely to happen?  The basics 
of remedial measures are introduced in the chapter on remedial 
measures. 
 
Making predictions about groups of people, like nat ions, is 
much more complicated than making predictions about  
individuals. Some basic techniques are introduced i n the 
chapter on mundane astrology.

Muhurta or electional astrology is an important bra nch of 
astrology. It lets us choose an auspicious time for  starting new 
ventures. A small chapter is dedicated to it. 
 
Vedic astrology is not a mundane subject like mathe matics and

astrologers are required to be spiritually aware an d observe 
some ethics. These are addressed in a small chapter. 
 
All these topics are covered for the sake of comple teness.

32.  Impact of Birthtime Error 
 
32.1  Introduction 
 
There are twins in this world who are born 1-2 minu tes apart, but live significantly 
different lives. There may be some similarities bet ween closely born twins, but there 
can be significant differences too. 
89  So this proves that divisional charts and special 
lagnas, which change very fast, have a great bearin g on a native’s fortune. If one’s 
birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, lagna and special lagnas in some divisional charts 
change and so the results change. This is how we ca n explain the differences 
between twins. 
 
Now the question is — if changes in lagna and speci al lagnas in divisional charts 
explain the different fortunes of twins, what about  people who don’t have a twin? 
Well, the same thing applies to them. If we analyze  the chart cast with a birthtime 
that is wrong by 2 minutes, we are no longer examin ing the chart of the native – we 
are simply looking at the chart of his hypothetical  twin! The results predicted need 
not be true. 
 
Lagna in D-1 changes rasi once in 2 hours. Some people make predictions only using 
D-1, but that is unscientific and against the teach ings of maharshis. Due to divine 
powers and God-given intuition, one can be successf ul in one’s predictions only 
using D-1, but that is clearly unscientific. We sho uld see different areas of life in 
different divisional charts, as taught by Maharshi Parasara. When we do that, we 
need an accurate birthtime. If one’s birthtime is b etween 9:02 am and 9:08 am, can 
we make accurate predictions using an average of 9: 05 am? No! Many people are 
born within the small span of 6 minutes (between 9: 02 and 9:08) and they can be 
significantly different from each other ( e.g.  twins). Applying precise techniques is 
pointless when we only have an approximate time. So  let us conclude that we must 
                                                
 
89  In order to explain the differences between twins,  some astrologers take the lagna of the second 
twin in the 3 rd  house (younger brother) from the first twin. If Aq uarius is rising at the birth of both, 
they take Aries (3 rd  from Aquarius) as the lagna of the younger twin. T his is, however, illogical, 
irrational and against the teachings of maharshis. One who understands what lagna means and what 
the rasi chart shows will reject such theories without any consideration at all. 

--- Page 433 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 421  
 
first make sure that we are working with an accurat e birthtime . Readers should 
remember that our analysis could be only as accurate as our data! 
 
We are often told by clients that their birthtime i s very accurate. However, it is this 
author’s experience that birthtimes reported by peo ple are seldom accurate. There 
can be various reasons behind a birthtime error: (1 ) using an unadjusted 
clock/wristwatch showing a slightly incorrect time,  (2) forgetting to note the 
birthtime exactly after birth and noting down it a little later with some manual 
correction applied to compensate for the lapse, (3)  wrong memory of mother or 
father when giving the correctly noted birthtime to an astrologer, (4) using the wrong 
definition of ‘birth’. 
 
Birthtime rectification is the process of correcting the reported birthtime  before 
proceeding to make predictions based on the birthti me. There are some formulas in 
literature for birthtime rectification, but these a ssume that human births happen in 
certain quanta. For example, an approach may assume  that nobody is born during a 
period of 3 minutes and people can be born in a per iod of half a minute then. Then 
again, nobody is born for 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a 
minute following it. Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can 
be born. Then we find the nearest “human birth can happen now” quantum from the 
reported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime. 
 
Out of these methods, some of the reasonable method s are the ones based on ( a) 
Tattva siddhaanta, ( b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, ( c) Kunda. The first method 
beyond the scope of this book and the other two fail the acid test of twins. If we were 
to apply those methods to the charts of twins born 2 minutes apart, the rectified 
birthtimes of the two twins would be either the same or too far apart. 
 
In essence, most of the birthtime rectification tec hniques described in literature do 
not work. The only correct way to rectify a birthti me is to find a time in the 
neighborhood of the reported birthtime so that we c an explain the nature, credentials, 
attitude and aptitude of the native and the known e vents from the native’s past. This 
is a laborious process, but there is no other way. 
 
Suppose we are told that one was born between 9:02 and 9:08 am and suppose we 
are looking at his chart. Because we don’t know the  exact birthtime, we can look at a 
range. If we do that, we are potentially looking at  thousands of people born during 
that time. Our native could be anyone among thousan ds of people born in that range.

 422 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
But all those thousands of people have significant differences. We want to identify 
our native among those thousands of people and the only way is to look at the known 
past. That’s the only thing that distinguishes him from others born closely. 
 
So we should look at 9:02, 9:03, 9:04 etc and see w hich one explains the known past 
better. The rectified birthtime is the birthtime wi th which the known life events of 
the native make sense. 
 
32.2  Robustness of Computations 
 
When we try different birthtimes, all the computati ons change. If we know how 
various computations are altered based on small cha nges in the birthtime, we can 
approach the problem of birthtime rectification int elligently. We will discuss the 
approximate impact of birthtime change on various computations. 
 
32.2.1  Divisional Charts 
 
Planets: 
 
Positions of planets in rasi chart and divisional c harts change very slowly. For 
example, Sun stays in one rasi for 30 days. He chan ges rasi in D-10 once in 30/10=3 
days. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 30/24=1.25 days. The speed of Mercury, 
Venus and Mars is comparable to Sun’s. Jupiter and Saturn are even slower. Moon is 
faster than all these planets. He stays in one rasi for 2.5 days or 60 hours. He changes 
rasi in D-10 once in 60/10=6 hours. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 60/24=2.5 
hours. 
 
If the uncertainty in birthtime is of the order of 5 minutes or 10 minutes, one may 
think that there is no problem with these planets a s they stay in the same rasi in all 
divisional charts for a lot longer time than 5-10 m inutes. However, if a planet is at a 
border and changes rasi in a divisional chart durin g those 5 minutes, we have to take 
that into consideration. Suppose Moon is is at 23Sc 59. Suppose That places him in 
the 8 
th  dasamsa of Sc, i.e.  Aq. Suppose lagna in D-10 is Cn. So D-10 has lagna  lord 
in 8 th . This makes the D-10 chart weak. On the other hand , it Moon is at 24Sc00 or 
above, he will be in the 9 th  dasamsa of Sc, i.e.  Pi. This puts lagna lord in 9 th  in D-10 
and the chart is strengthened. Because Moon moves by one quarter of a nakshatra (or 
200 arc-min) in 6 hours (or 360 min), he takes 360/ 200=1.8 min to move by 1 arc-

--- Page 435 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 423  
 
min. For Moon to go from 23Sc59 to 24Sc00, it only takes about 2 minutes. 90  If we 
cannot rule out an error of 2 minutes, we should co nsider Moon in both Aq and Pi 
and see which one explains the native’s career better. 
 
Thus, we should pay attention if any planet is at a  rasi border in the divisional chart 
of interest. If so, we must consider both the positions and see which one makes better 
sense based on known past. 
 
Lagna: 
 
Lagna changes rasi in divisional charts much faster  than planets. So it is the most 
important consideration in birthtime rectification. 
 
Lagna moves by one rasi (30º) in 2 hours or 120 min . To move by 1º, lagna takes 
about 4 min. 
 
Lesson : Lagna moves by 1º in 4 min. Lagna moves by 10' in 2/3 min (or 40 
seconds). Lagna moves by 1' in 4 sec. Lagna moves by 10'' in 2/3 sec. 
 
We can see that lagna changes rasi in D-10 in 12 mi n. It changes rasi in D-24 in 5 
min. 
 
Example 129:   Suppose we are told that someone was born at 9:05  am. Suppose 
lagna is at 4Sg39. Suppose we have events related t o D-10 (career), D-12 (parents) 
and D-24 (education). Lagna at 4Sg39 puts lagna in these 3 charts in Cp, Cp and Sc 
(respectively). Suppose the birthtime is reasonably  accurate and the maximum error 
is 5 minutes ( i.e.  birthtime can be 9:00-9:10). Let us find the possi ble lagnas in the 3 
charts. 
 
An error of 5 min changes lagna by about 5/4=1.25º or 1º15'. So, instead of being 
4Sg39, it can be as low as 3Sg24 or as high as 5Sg5 4. So we should consider all 
lagnas between 3Sg24 and 5Sg54. In D-10, lagna chan ges rasi at multiples of 3º. So 
the whole range we have for lagna results in the sa me D-10 lagna (Cp). In D-12, 
                                                
 
90  We are assuming here that our computation of Moon’ s longitude is very accurate. There are some 
unresolved controversies like (1) ayanamsa and (2) geocentric positions vs topocentric positions. Due 
to these controversies, we cannot be confident of o ur calculations. It is prudent to consider both the  
rasis in border-line situations. 

--- Page 436 ---
  
 
 424 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
lagna changes rasi at multiples of 2º30'. So we hav e a transition at 5º. So there are 
two possibilities for lagna – one in 3Sg24-5Sg00 an d the other in 5Sg00-5Sg54. So 
lagna in D-12 can be Cp or Aq. Lagna in D-24 change s rasi at multiples of 1º15'. It 
changes rasi at 3º45' and 5º00'. So we have 3 possi bilities for lagna – (1) 3Sg24-
3Sg45: Li, (2) 3Sg45-5Sg00: Sc, (3) 5Sg00-5Sg54: Sg. 
 
Using these sets of lagnas, we should analyze the c harts and see which one makes 
sense. Suppose Sg lagna in D-24 and Aq lagna in D-1 2 explain known events. But 
suppose we cannot explain his career. Suppose Aq la gna instead of Cp lagna 
explains his career well. Then what do we do? 
 
To get the next rasi as D-10 lagna (Aq instead of C p), we should cross the next D-10 
border, which is 6Sg00. So the lagna should become 6Sg00 (or higher) instead of 
4Sg39. So we have to add 1º21' or higher to lagna. Lagna moves by 1º21' or 81' in 
81 
x4 sec = 324 sec = 5 min 24 sec. 
 
This means that the birthtime should be 9:10:24 ins tead of 9:05. Though we are told 
that the error in birthtime cannot be more than 5 m inutes, it has to be more than 5 
minutes in this case to explain known facts. 
 
Please note that these calculations are made on the  assumption that lagna moves 
uniformly. That is not the case in reality. So the actual rectified birthtime may be a 
little off. We can do approximate calculations firs t and then see if it has to be 
corrected further. For example, we may get lagna at  9:10:24 to be 5Sg59 instead of 
the expected value of 6Sg00. Then we have to add a few more seconds and see if we 
cross 6Sg00. 
 
One may see from this example that an astrologer sh ould know the details of the 
computation of divisional charts and be familiar wi th the longitudes at which lagna 
changes rasi in various divisional charts. That fam iliarity is a necessity for quick 
birthtime rectification. 
 
Special Lagnas: 
 
Hora lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Ghati lagna moves 5 times as fast as lagna. 
 
 
Lesson :

HL moves by 1º in 2 min. HL moves by 10' in 1/3 min (or 20 seconds). HL moves by 
1' in 2 sec. HL moves by 10'' in 1/3 sec. 
 
GL moves by 1º in 4/5 min (or 48 seconds). GL moves  by 10' in 4.8 seconds. GL 
moves by 1' in 0.48 sec (less than half a second). 
 
Exercise 50: Suppose someone is born at 9:05 am and has GL at 2 0Le37. This puts 
GL in D-10 in Aq. Suppose we expect the D-10 GL in Ar to explain the native’s 
periods of power and authority. What should the correct birthtime be? 
 
32.2.2  Dasas 
 
Rasi dasas based on rasi chart change only if lagna  changes rasi or a planet changes 
rasi. Because lagna changes rasi once in 2 hours, w e do not have to deal with 
inaccuracies in rasi dasas in most cases. 
 
Narayana dasa of divisional charts does not change in a small period of time, unless 
a planet changes rasi in the divisional chart of interest. 
 
However, the dasa start dates in nakshatra dasas ch ange with small changes in 
birthtime. Let us say the complete duration (and no t just the remainder at birth) of 
the dasa running at birth is n years. Let us say the birthtime is wrong by m minutes. 
Moon stays in the nakshatra for about 24 
x60 minutes (24 hours) and the error in the 
fraction of Moon’s constellation that is yet to be traversed is m/(24 x60). The error in 
the number of days of dasa left is nx360 xm/(24 x60) = ( n x m)/4. If we add m minutes 
to the birthtime, we should subtract ( n x m)/4 days from dasa dates and vice versa. 
 
If 7 years of Venus dasa remains at birth, then n = 20 and the approximate error in 
dasa dates is 20 m/4 = 5 m days, where m is the birthtime error in minutes. If the 
birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, dasa dates are wrong by 10 days. 
 
If the birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes and 3 years of Moon dasa were remaining at 
birth, then n = 10 and m = 2 and the error in dasa dates is 10
x2/4 = 5 days. 
 
In Kalachakra dasa, the error is more. If n years is the paramayush of the sequence 
corresponding to the navamsa of natal Moon and m minutes is the error in birthtime, 

--- Page 438 ---
  
 
 426 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
the error in the dates of dasa is ( n x m) days. If we add m minutes to the birthtime, we 
should subtract ( n x m) days from dasa dates and vice versa. 
 
For example, if the paramayush is 100 years and the  birthtime error is 2 minutes, 
then the error in dates is 200 days. It is almost 7 months! 
 
For this reason, it is futile to use pratyantardasa s in Kalachakra dasa unless one is 
absolutely confident of the birthtime. 
 
32.2.3  Tajaka Charts 
 
If the change in lagna in the natal chart due to a birthtime change is x, then the lagna 
in the Tajaka annual and monthly charts will also c hange by approximately x. 
However, we have to keep in mind that the list of d ivisional charts in which lagna is 
near rasi borders may change. 
 
For example, let us say that natal lagna is at 23Sc 30 and lagna in a Tajaka annual 
chart for 1980-81 is at 15Cn05. Let us say that the  birthtime can have an error of 
upto 3 minutes (either way – plus or minus). Let us  say that we are interested in the 
career of the native and especially in an event in career that took place in 1980-81. In 
natal D-10, lagna (23Sc30) is in the middle of the 8 
th  dasamsa in Sc. Unless the 
birthtime changes by more than 6 minutes in either direction, lagna in D-10 will not 
change. However, lagna in 1980-81 Tajaka annual chart is close to a dasamsa border. 
If lagna is just below 15º in Cn, lagna in D-10 will be in the 5 th  from Pi. i.e.  Cn itself. 
If lagna is just above 15º in Cn, lagna in D-10 wil l be in the 6 th  from Pi, i.e.  Le. With 
the given birthtime, we get 15Cn05 and so lagna in D-10 in the Tajaka chart is in Le. 
But it could be Cn if the native’s birth took place  half a minute before the reported 
birthtime. 
 
Thus, sometimes we cannot detect a birthtime error just by looking at the natal chart 
and dasas. Looking at the divisional charts of Taja ka annual charts can help in some 
cases. 
 
The assumption here is that one casts Tajaka charts  very accurately. This is not true 
with those who use the approximate method taught in  this boo or those who find the 
exact solar return but use an approximate formula f or Sun’s motion or use a linear 
formula for ayanamsa. 
 

--- Page 439 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 427  
 
The actual ayanamsa used matters only to a small ex tent, in the sense that it has the 
same impact on the longitude of lagna and the rasis  occupied by lagna in various 
divisional charts, as it has in the natal chart. On the other hand, using an approximate 
linear formula for ayanamsa brings minor discrepanc y in Sun’s longitude which is 
multiplied by 360 in the longitude of lagna. This r esults in a serious error. Though 
we do not know exactly when Nirayana zodiac coincid ed with the Sayana zodiac, we 
do know the exact nonlinear formula of the precessi on. So one hoping to use Tajaka 
charts in birthtime rectification must  use the correct nonlinear formula of the 
ayanamsa of one’s choice. Unfortunately, many peopl e use linear approximations. 
They are not good enough for Tajaka charts. 
 
32.3  A Practical Approach 
 
It is a good idea to first determine the correct D- 9 lagna or D-10 lagna and then go to 
the other divisional charts. We should first determ ine that the birthtime is between 
9:05 and 9:15. Then we can determine that it is bet ween 9:07 and 9:11. Then we can 
use a more precise criterion and narrow down furthe r. Thus we narrow down further 
and further with each criterion. 
 
If one’s marriage has already taken place, we can u se D-9 to see it and fix D-9 lagna. 
If not, we can see one’s general sense of duty, one’s basic skills and one’s interaction 
with others and fix D-9 lagna based on them. Then w e can go to a higher divisional 
chart. However, in reality, sometimes it may become  necessary to come back to D-9. 
For example, suppose someone can have lagna in D-9 in Li or Sc. Suppose we think 
that Li is also a good candidate but Sc is better. Then the candidates for D-24 lagna 
that we get with this choice may not make sense. It  may make sense to place lagna in 
D-24 in another rasi and that may require lagna in D-9 to be in Li. In that case, we 
can revisit D-9 and change the lagna.  
 
Trying to first do a broad rectification with D-9 a nd D-10 and then doing a fine 
rectification with high divisional charts like D-20 and Kalachakra dasa will provide a 
systematic approach to the problem, but we should b e willing to come back to the 
first step if we are stuck in the second step. 
 
After a couple of examples, this approach may become clearer.

32.4  Practical Examples 
 
Example 130: Let us consider a gentleman whose birthdata is repo rted as: 30 
th  
November 1966, 10:36 am (IST), 77 E 47, 11 N 19. Hi s D-4 and D-9 are shown in 
Chart 75 and his D-10 and D-24 are shown in Chart 76. 
 
Lagna with the reported birthtime is at 13Cp16. Let  us approach the problem of 
rectification in a pyramid-like approach. First let  us verify D-4 lagna. The native left 
his motherland and went to USA in Jupiter dasa. In D-4, Jupiter owns 9 
th  (flourishing 
abroad) and 12 th  (staying away from motherland) and he occupies the  7 th  house (long 
journeys). Rahu is the primary significator of fore ign residence and he joins Jupiter. 
For these reasons, Jupiter dasa can certainly take him abroad. So lagna in D-4 is most 
probably correct. 
 
D-4 lagna changes rasi at multiples of 7.5º. The la gna we used above (13Cp16) is 
between 7.5º and 15º in Cp. So we conclude that lag na is between 7Cp30 and 
15Cp00. 
 
Next, let us look at navamsa. In navamsa, lagna cha nges rasi at multiples of 3º20'. 
Here is changes at 13Cp20. The given lagna (13Cp16)  is just below it. We see from 
Chart 75 that navamsa lagna is in Ar. However, with  a very small error, it can be Ta 
also. Let us consider both. 
 
If we take navamsa lagna in Ar, the native should b e dynamic (Ar), spiritual and 
possibly short-tempered (Ketu). With Venus and Moon in trines, he should be skilled 
at singing or other arts. But he isn’t. With Mercur y in the 2 
nd  house, he should be a 
skilled speaker. However, he isn’t really a skillful speaker. 
 
If we take navamsa lagna in Ta, the native should be a hard-working and sincere (Ta) 
intellectual (Mercury). He should be mild-mannered,  liked by most people and 
learned in many subjects (Mercury). This descriptio n fits the native better. So 
probably lagna is above 13Cp20.

 Part 5: Special Topics 429  
 
Chart 75 
 
 

--- Page 442 ---
  
 
 430 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Chart 76 
 
 
We have narrowed to the range 13Cp20-15Cp00, based on lagna in D-4 and D-9. 
Now let us consider D-10, the chart of career. The native is a dynamic software 
engineer. In D-10, AL shows one’s status in career and how people perceive one. 
Here AL is in Virgo and its lord Mercury aspects it . So he is perceived in his career 

--- Page 443 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 431  
 
as an intelligent person (Virgo and Mercury). The 1 0 th  house from AL has Mercury 
and Mars and it can explain a career in software. 
 
So probably lagna in D-10 is correct. This confirms  that lagna is between 12Cp00 
and 15Cp00. But we have no further narrowing down b ecause of D-10. We still have 
13Cp20-15Cp00 as the rectified window. 
 
Now let us go to a higher level divisional chart an d take D-24, the chart of education 
and learning. The native studied computer science a t a good engineering college in 
India during his Jupiter dasa. With lagna in Ta, th e 4 
th  house of education is in Le. 
Sun owns it. Rahu, Ketu, Venus and Mars aspect it. With this, education in medicine 
or management is likely. Education in computer scie nce is unlikely. Moreover, 
education in Jupiter dasa is unlikely. 
 
If we take the birthtime above 13Cp45, lagna in D-2 4 changes from Ta to Ge. Then 
the 4 
th  house is in Vi, aspected by Mercury, Moon and Jupi ter. Mercury and Virgo 
can give education in computer science. Jupiter is in own house. He aspects the 4 th  
house and joins 4 th  lord Mercury. So his dasa can give education. A4 i s in Ge and 
Sun occupies it. So he may study at a popular college of engineering or science. 
 
To get lagna in D-24 in Ge instead of Ta, lagna nee ds to be above 13Cp45. So the 
final rectified birthtime window after looking at t he four divisional charts is 13Cp45-
15Cp00. To narrow down further, we need to look at D-40, D-45 and D-60. We can 
also use Kalachakra dasa. 
 
With a birthtime of 10:36 am, we have lagna at 13Cp 16 and Kalachakra dasa of Ta 
runs from 1987 to 2003. The native got married at t he end of 1996. Ta dasa makes 
sense because navamsa lagna is in Ta. We should look at antardasa now. Pi antardasa 
starts in May 1995, Ar antardasa in April 1997 and Ta antardasa in Aug 1998. 
 
Because the rectified birthtime has to be between 13Cp45 and 15Cp00, let us first try 
13Cp45. We need to add half a degree to lagna. So w e need to add 2 minutes to 
birthtime and make it 10:38 am. The paramayush is 86 years and if we add 2 minutes 
to the birthtime, we should subtract 82 
x2 = 164 days from dasa dates. This brings the 
start date of Ar antardasa to Oct 1996 and Ta antar dasa to Feb 1998. However, 
marriage is unlikely in Pi and Ar antardasas. With Ta being lagna and Ge being the 
7th  house from Venus, marriage is most likely in Ta an d Ge antardasas. So the start 
date of Ta antardasa must be moved from Feb 1998 to  the end of 1996. We need to 

--- Page 444 ---
  
 
 432 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
subtract about 400 days from the dasa dates. This r equires further addition of 
400/86=4.7 minutes to the birthtime. This will add another degree to lagna and lagna 
will be just below 15º. The rectified birthtime is around 10:42:30. The error in the 
reported birthtime can be due to errors in the clock used. 
 
Of course, if we use the rectified birthdata and ve rify a few more events in the life of 
the native, we can be more confident that the rectification is correct. 
 
Example 131: Suppose an astrologer friend of ours approaches us  with the rasi chart 
of a gentleman, shown in Chart 77. Because the birt h happened in 1939, we cannot 
rule out huge errors. The error need not be just 2 or 3 minutes. An error of even 10 
minutes is possible. 
Chart 77 
 
 
Let us say that the only thing our friend knows abo ut this gentleman is that he thinks 
that 1978-79 was the golden period of life in terms  of his finances and that he has 
been experiencing financial tightness since 1996-97. We have to rectify the chart just 
based on this information. 
 

--- Page 445 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 433  
 
Which dasa should we use for financial matters? It is Sudasa. Let us find Sudasa. 
 
Moon is at 13º13'25'' in Leo. He is in Makha conste llation, which runs from 0º to 
13º20' in Le. His advancement in nakshatra is (13º1 3'25'')/ (13º20') = 
(793.4167')/(800') = 0.99177. The same fraction of the entire zodiac is 0.99177 
x360 
= 357.0375º = 357º 2' 15''. Adding this to lagna, w e get Sree Lagna. Lagna is at 
17º35'50'' in Pi. So we get Sree Lagna at 14º38'5''  in Pi. Sudasa starts from Pi. 
Because Sree Lagna is in an even rasi, Sudasa goes backward. We reckon quadrants, 
panapharas and apoklimas backwards and get Pi, Sg, Vi, Ge, Aq, Sc, Le, Ta, Cp, Li, 
Cn and Ar. Dasa periods are as in Narayana dasa. Ho wever, there is an exception for 
the first dasa. Because Jupiter is in Pi, Pi dasa i s for 12 years. However, only a 
fraction of this is left at birth, based on the fra ction of the rasi yet to be traversed by 
Sree Lagna. This fraction is (30º – 14º38'5'')/ 30º  = 0.51218. So the remainder of Pi 
dasa at birth is 0.51218 x12 years = 6 years 1 month 23 days. 
 
We get dasas as 
 
Pi (6.15 yrs):  Sep 12, 1939 – Oct 03, 1945 
Sg (03 years):  Oct 03, 1945 – Oct 03, 1948 
Vi (01 years):  Oct 03, 1948 – Oct 03, 1949 
Ge (02 years):  Oct 03, 1949 – Oct 03, 1951 
Aq (09 years):  Oct 03, 1951 – Oct 03, 1960 
Sc (05 years):  Oct 03, 1960 – Oct 03, 1965 
Le (12 years):  Oct 03, 1965 – Oct 03, 1977 
Ta (03 years):  Oct 03, 1977 – Oct 03, 1980 
Cp (08 years):  Oct 03, 1980 – Oct 03, 1988 
Li (10 years):  Oct 03, 1988 – Oct 03, 1998 
Cn (11 years):  Oct 03, 1998 – Oct 03, 2009 
 
Why did the native start feeling financial tightnes s in 1996-97? Libra dasa was 
running then. Though Libra has Rahu in it, it is ne vertheless the 11 
th  house from AL. 
Sudasa of the 11 th  house from AL is usually favorable. 
 
However, we see that Cn dasa started in 1998. Cn is  the 8 
th  house from AL. The 8 th  
house from AL stands for fall of status and materia l setbacks. It can certainly show 
financial tightness in Sudasa. Though two good upag rahas (Artha Prahara and 
Yamaghantaka – similar to Mercury and Jupiter in ef fects) are present in it, Cn 
contains two highly malefic upagrahas also – Indrachapa and Upaketu. 
 

--- Page 446 ---
  
 
 434 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
If the native has been experiencing financial tight ness since Cn dasa started, it makes 
good sense. So probably Cn dasa should start in mid -1996 instead of Oct 1998. What 
is the required change in birth time for this change in Sudasa dates? 
 
Exercise 51: We calculated the formulas for the approximate cha nge in Vimsottari 
dasa and Kalachakra dasa dates if birthtime changes  by m minutes. Do the same 
thing for Sudasa. 
 
Complete the exercise before reading further. Based  on the formula at the end of the 
exercise, dates of dasas in Sudasa move back by 6 
x12 xm days if we add m minutes to 
the birthtime. We want it to move by 2 years or 720  days. So m should be 
720/(6 x12), i.e.  10. We should add 10 minutes to the birthtime and make it 7:40 pm. 
However, after calculating Sudasa for a birthtime o f 7:40 pm, we realize that the 
dates of dasas have moved by almost 2.5 years inste ad of 2 years 91 . To get dasa start 
dates 2 years earlier, we just need to make the birthtime 7:38 pm. 
 
With this new time, Cn dasa started in mid-1996. Wi th Cn being the 8 
th  house from 
AL, its dasa gave financial tightness. 
 
Example 132:  Suppose the rasi chart in Chart 78 is given to us as the chart of 
Microsoft company’s Bill Gates. Suppose we have ver ified several divisional charts 
and they seem fine. Suppose we want to micro-rectify it. 
 
The technique to be used for birthtime rectificatio n varies from chart to chart. If 
one’s D-10 lagna is close to a rasi border, we shou ld use a technique that is sensitive 
to D-10 lagna and see which alternative makes bette r sense. If GL is close to a rasi 
border, we should use a technique that depends crit ically on GL and see which 
alternative makes better sense. 
 
Here one can note that Sree Lagna (SL) is on a rasi  border. With the birthtime of 
9:15 pm, SL is at 28Ar15. If a few minutes are adde d to the birthtime, SL will be in 
Ta. We should use a technique that is sensitive to the rasi occupied by SL and see 
whether SL in Ar or Ta makes better sense. 
                                                
 
91  The error in our approximations is due to assuming  that lagna and Moon move at a certain uniform 
rate. The rate at which they move is not really lin ear/uniform. So the formulas given here should only  
be used for reference. One should finally compute c harts and dasas for the rectified time and verify 
the rectification.

 Part 5: Special Topics 435  
 
 
Of course, Sudasa depends on SL and we should compute Sudasa. 
Chart 78 
 
 
If SL is in Ar, Sudasa starts from Ar and goes as A r, Cn, Li, Cp, Ta, Le, Sc etc . If SL 
is in Ta, Sudasa starts from Ta. Normally it will g o as Ta, Aq, Sc, Le, Ar, Cp, Li etc , 
but Ketu’s presence in Ta reverses the direction. S o Sudasa goes as Ta, Le, Sc, Aq, 
Ge, Vi, Sg etc . 
 
In the first case, one can see that Scorpio dasa ru ns from 1990 to 2000. In the second 
case, Virgo dasa runs during 1988-2000. Bill Gates was financially very successful 
and he became the world’s richest man in late 1990’ s. Which dasa explains his 
financial success better? 
 
Scorpio is the 3 
rd  house from AL and upachayas from AL bring improvem ents in 
one’s status. However, Scorpio has no aspect on HL.  Moreover, it is afflicted by 
Rahu. So Scorpio dasa is not that great. 
 

--- Page 448 ---
  
 
 436 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
On the other hand, Virgo dasa can bring excellent r esults. It contains AL and its 
exalted lord. It is aspected by bhaagya pada (A9, a rudha pada of the 9 th  house) and 
occupied by the exalted lord of bhagya pada. The 9 th  house shows one’s fortune. One 
may be fortunate to have a good guru and one may be  fortunate to have a good 
leader. But the world’s perceptions of one’s fortune are driven by the recognition one 
gets and formal distinctions like being named in Fo rbes list of richest men. These are 
what drive the world’s perceptions about one’s fort une. A9 shows them the best. If 
Sudasa of a rasi containing the exalted lord of A9 and aspected by A9 runs, it can 
very much bring material fortune of the highest kin d. Moreover, Vi aspects HL in 
Sg. For all these reasons, SL in Ta explains the na tive’s known past better. So we 
should add a few minutes to the birthtime. 
Chart 79 
 
 
Example 133:  Let us consider a lady whose D-10 is shown in Char t 79. She is a 
good singer and sang in some radio and television p rograms in India, but her career 
was cut down when she got married to an Indian engi neer in USA and went to USA 
with him. In 1998, she started a music school in US A and started teaching Carnatic 
(south Indian classical) music. 
 

--- Page 449 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 437  
 
In her D-10, Mars in the 10 th  house shows own ventures and enterprise. The 10 th  lord 
Sun joins Venus in the 5 th  house and shows fame as a singer. Sun-Venus 
combination can show music. Venus stands for creati ve activities. Sun and Moon 
stand for music. Sun stands for rhythm and Moon sta nds for melody. So a career in 
music is possible. As per Vimsottari dasa, Sun dasa  started in 1998. This may be 
why her career was restarted in 1998. Let us check her Kalachakra dasa. 
 
Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius started in October 1999 . It may be noted that Aquarius 
contains Venus and 10 
th  lord Sun. So Kalachakra dasa must have started jus t before 
she started her music institute. To get the Kalachakra dasas a little earlier, we need to 
add a little to the birthtime. So we should add a f ew minutes to the birthtime and 
make sure that Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius starts just before her career is restarted. 
 
We have so far looked at 4 examples. In the first e xample, we had to look at several 
divisional charts to rectify the birthtime. In the second example, we rectified the 
birthtime based on a dasa. We did it because the pa st events given to us relate to an 
area of life (finances), for which there is an appr opriate dasa. In the 3 
rd  chart also, we 
used the same dasa, but for a different reason. We did it because a key parameter was 
on a rasi border. In the 4 th  example, we used Kalachakra dasa. Being a sensitive dasa, 
Kalachakra dasa is usually very useful in carrying out a fine birthtime rectification. 
 
One should choose the approach on a chart-by-chart basis. The information provided 
by a client about past events should decide the tec hniques to be used. Birthtime 
rectification is an area in which one can become go od only after considerable 
practice. There are no hard and fast rules.  
 
32.5  Conclusion 
 
There are two kinds of birthtime rectification – ma cro-rectification and micro-
rectification. Macro-rectification is the case when  you have two or more totally 
different birthdata from different sources and want  to find out which is correct. For 
example, there are different versions of Sri A.B. V ajpayee’s birthdata. If we want to 
find out which is correct, we have to look at vario us divisional charts and life events 
and see which one works better. 
 

--- Page 450 ---
  
 
 438 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Micro-rectification is the one that we will need th e most in practical consultations. 
The birthdata reported by clients usually has a lit tle error and we have to rectify the 
birthtime. 
 
Some people use some formula based techniques for b irthtime rectification and 
assume that human births happen only in certain qua nta of time. Most of those 
techniques do not work. The only correct way to rec tify a birthtime is to correct it in 
such a way that one’s nature and past life events a re well explained. An astrologer 
should have an idea of the change introduced in various computations if the birthtime 
changes a little. Using lagna in D-9, D-10 etc , we can broadly rectify the birthtime. 
Then we can rectify it with a finer precision by go ing to higher divisional charts like 
D-20 and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple o f examples were provided in 
this book. Readers should understand the examples t horoughly and practice these 
techniques with as many charts as they can. The ada ge that practice makes one 
perfect is particularly true in this area. Readers should remember that correct 
birthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for  the entire chart analysis – without 
correct birthtime rectification, all other fine tec hniques we learnt in this book are 
useless. 
 
32.6  Answers to Exercises 
 
Exercise 50: 
 
GL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3º . Here it goes from Aq to Pi when 
GL crosses 21º. It goes from Pi to Ar when GL cross es 24º. So GL has to be at or 
above 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24º0' – 20º 37' = 3º 21' = 201'. 
 
GL moves by 201' in 201 
x 0.48 sec = 96.48 sec = 1 min 6.48 sec. So we shoul d 
roughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or above. 
 
There is an upper limit also. If it becomes too hig h, GL in D-10 will move from Ar 
to Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes t he best sense. So we cannot add 
another 3º to GL. GL moves by 3º in 3 
x 4/5 = 12/5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this 
to 9:06:07, we get 9:08:31. So the birthtime should  be between 9:06:07 am and 
9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar.

If we create several inequations like the above usi ng lagna and special lagnas in 
various divisional charts, we can narrow down to the correct birthtime. 
 
Exercise 51: 
 
Lagna moves by 30º if the birthtime changes by 120 minutes. If the birthtime 
changes by m minutes, lagna changes by ( m/120) 
x30 = ( m/4)º. Moon moves by 3º20' 
(one quarter of a nakshatra) in 6 hours or 360 minu tes. So, if the birthtime changes 
by m minutes, Moon’s longitude changes by ( m/360) x(3º20'). So the fraction of the 
nakshatra occupied by Moon that is already traverse d by Moon, changes by 
(m/360) x(3º20')/(13º20')= m/(360 x4). When we find this as a fraction of the zodiac, 
the change is 360º xm/(360 x4) = ( m/4)º. The error in Sree Lagna is the sum of the 
error in lagna and the error in this fraction of zo diac. So Sree Lagna changes by 
(m/4)º + ( m/4)º = ( m/2)º. 
 
Lesson:  Sree Lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Hora lagn a and Sree lagna, which 
move twice as fast as lagna, show the matters relat ed to the 2 nd  house, i.e.  money 
(HL is useful in death also). Ghati lagna, which mo ves 5 times as fast as lagna, 
shows the matters related to the 5 th  house, i.e.  fame, power and authority. 
 
If Sree Lagna increases by ( m/2)º, then (30º – Sree Lagna) decreases by ( m/2)º. The 
fraction (30º – Sree Lagna)/30º decreases by ( m/60). If the complete length of the 
first dasa is n years, then the remainder of the first dasa at bir th decreases by 
n
x(m/60) years = (6 x n x m) days. If the remainder of the first dasa at birth  decreases 
by these many days, all dasas come these many days earlier . 
 
Formula: If the complete Narayana dasa length of the first d asa in Sudasa is n years 
and the birthtime changes by m minutes, all the dasa and antardasa dates change b y 
approximately (6 x n x m) days. If the birthtime is earlier, dasas will com e later and 
vice versa. 
 
C
AUTION : When we consider a change in birthtime by m minutes, it is possible that 
Moon changes nakshatra during the time. The above c alculations still hold. When 
Moon is at the end of a nakshatra, the amount added  to lagna to get Sree lagna is just 
below 360º. When Moon moves to the next nakshatra, it changes to 0º. Though we 
have a big change in numbers, it is a continuous ch ange and 360º = 0º. So we need 
not worry and we can use the above formula. However , if Sree Lagna changes rasi 
during the m minutes, Sudasa calculation changes completely and  the above formula 

--- Page 452 ---
  
 
 440 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
is no longer valid. For example, if Sree Lagna is a t 29º in Ar and we consider adding 
4 min to the birthtime, it changes Sree Lagna by (4 /2)º and it goes to 1º in Ta. The 
whole dasa sequence changes now and we cannot use the above formula.

33.  Rational Thinking 
 
33.1  Introduction 
 
Astrology lovers insist that it is a science. But any conscientious person familiar with 
the modern definition of “science” will agree that it is not a science. It may  have 
been a science a few thousand years back, but it is  no longer a science. A lot of 
astrological knowledge of Vedic times became corrup t in the last few hundred years, 
because of the degeneration of Indian culture preci pitated by foreign invasions. The 
correct knowledge of the science of Vedic astrology  is broken into parts and hidden 
in small corners of India. There are a lot of tradi tional families in India, which guard 
some special astrological techniques as “family sec rets”. The knowledge that is 
explicitly taught in most books – including this book – is either incomplete or simply 
incorrect. Gathering the correct knowledge from the  remote corners of India and 
consolidating it is a daunting task. 
 
It makes no sense to start from scratch and develop  this subject completely. The best 
approach is to understand the teachings of Sages co rrectly and then experiment to 
confirm our understanding. However, it is easier sa id than done. Astrologers don’t 
agree even on the basics – such as the zodiac to be  used and the ayanamsa. There are 
just too many things that are ambiguous and not com pletely clarified in classics. To 
complicate things further, some modern savants are making their own ill-considered 
departures from the teachings of Sages and foolishl y popularizing them. That only 
adds to the corruption of this knowledge. 
 
The bottom line is — things are in a mess and astro logy is far from being a science. 
However, readers need not despair. It is this autho r’s prediction that astrology 
research will flourish in the coming century and a lot of long-standing issues will be 
resolved conclusively. 
 
Understanding and accepting that a problem exists i s the first step in fixing it. This 
author’s intention is to make the readers aware of the problems. While we certainly 
want to keep the sanctity of the subject of astrolo gy intact and not unduly worry 
about having it accepted as a science, it can only do good to apply the paradigms of 
modern science and approach astrology with a rational outlook.

33.2  Irrational Explanations 
 
Because of the corruption that is rampant in astrological knowledge, people often use 
wrong principles to explain an event and fail in pr esenting straight-forward and 
sound logic. They beat around the bush to explain an event sometimes. 
 
Example 134: We may hear people making a typing mistake and say ing,“Mercury is 
retrograde. That is why people are making mistakes these days”. Pray, do these 
mistakes happen only when Mercury is retrograde? Or , do they happen with a 
considerably higher frequency when Mercury is retro grade? Mercury’s retrogression 
may last a couple of weeks and do the mistakes happ en exactly during those two 
weeks? 
 
If not, how can we correlate Mercury’s retrogressio n and the typing mistakes? 
Probably the mistakes happen all the time, but they  are more frequent during a few 
days. But the reason has to be a sookshma dasa or a  praana dasa or a Bhrigu transit 
during that time, rather than Mercury’s retrogression. 
 
We should look at the nature of the event and the t ime period of its effectiveness and 
look for an astrological factor with about the same  period of effectiveness. One may 
make typing mistakes everyday, but a particular day may be worse than usual. In that 
case, the period of effectiveness of the event ( viz  making too many typing mistakes) 
is that day. A month-long retrogression or a year-l ong transit cannot be its reason. If 
we correlate it with an astrological factor with th e same period of effectiveness ( e.g.  
a sookshma dasa of Narayana dasa or Mercury’s D-27 transit in a sign occupied in 
natal rasi chart by Rahu), it is plausible. But if we attribute the event to retrograde 
Mercury or debilitated Jupiter, it is not logical. 
 
Example 135:  Someone may have a very bad time at his office on a particular 
afternoon. He may say,“oh, it’s because I am runnin g the Vimsottari dasa of the 8 
th  
lord in D-10.” 
 
It is true that the 8 
th  lord in D-10 can give the results experienced, but  that doesn’t 
mean his dasa was responsible for an isolated event  in an afternoon. If one has 

--- Page 455 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 443  
 
similar experiences frequently, during the entire p eriod of a dasa, then we can blame 
that dasa. After all, a dasa shows the overall mood in a long period of time. 
 
However, if that is not the case and the experience  is an isolated incident, then it is 
irrational to explain it using a dasa. Some other a strological factor with a smaller 
period of effect may have caused the event. For exa mple, Moon may be transiting in 
D-10 in a rasi occupied by Saturn and Rahu in natal  rasi chart. Moon, Sun and lagna 
lord in D-10 may be transiting in kakshyas without a rekha. The latter may show a 
bad period of a few days and the former factor with  a period of effectiveness of 
about 6 hours may have triggered the event. 
 
We will find the correct factor behind an event onl y if we search for it without 
compromising. A true researcher never compromises. Of course, there may be many 
astrological factors contributing to the manufactur ing of an event and we may not be 
able to find all of them because we don’t know all the possible techniques. 
Nevertheless, we should try to find the right facto r within the limits of our 
knowledge. Accepting a wrong factor as the reason f or an event is illogical. 
Attributing an isolated incident  in a day to a dasa that runs for 10 years is irrational. 
 
Some astrologers may make a correct prediction base d on illogical thinking, due to 
luck (or spiritual strength). We should not be blin ded by the success of a prediction. 
Success of a prediction does not prove the validity  of the methods used. We may try 
to enhance our predictive success through good spir itual practices, but we should 
also try to identify the right factors behind vario us events and consolidate the 
scientific aspects of Vedic astrology. The scientif ic and spiritual aspects of astrology 
should go together and strengthen each other. 
 
33.3  Known Past vs Future 
 
Some authors present some principles in their books  and present many examples that 
show the efficacy of the principles. 
 
However, one finds many times that these principles  are too vague to be useful in 
practice. They are good enough to explain known pas t, but not good enough to 
predict future. 
 

--- Page 456 ---
  
 
 444 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
An extreme example will make this clearer. Suppose someone presents us with a 
principle: “Someone born with lagna in an airy sign  gets married when Venus 
transits in an own sign or a friendly sign or a wat ery sign or a trine from natal 7 th  
house”. It may make sense to us, because Venus is t he significator of marriage and 
being in an own sign or a friendly sign or a watery  sign makes this watery planet 
strong. Also, Venus transiting in a trine from nata l 7 th  house may seem favorable for 
marriage to occur. 
 
We may test this principle against as many examples  as we want and we will find it 
to be satisfied in 100% cases. Does that mean that this is an excellent principle? 
 
No! This is not  a meaningful or useful principle at all. Why? The list given covers 
the entire zodiac. Ta and Li are own signs of Venus . Ge, Vi, Cp and Aq are friendly 
signs. Cn, Sc and Pi are watery signs. Ar, Le and S g are trines from the 7 
th  house for 
any person with lagna in an airy sign. If you count the signs, you will find that all the 
twelve signs are covered! So the principle indirect ly means, “someone born in an 
airy sign gets married when Venus transits in one o f the 12 signs”. Of course, Venus 
transits one of the 12 signs always and this is a t rivially correct statement. So it will 
be satisfied in the case of all people with lagna in an airy sign. 
 
But, can we use it to make any predictions? If we g et the chart of someone with 
lagna in an airy sign, can we predict using this pr inciple when he will get married? 
No! 
 
This is the problem with vague astrological princip les. True, this is an extreme 
example, but didn’t “Venus in own or friendly or wa tery sign or a trine from the 7 
th  
house” make some sense to us? However, it turned ou t to be too general (or vague) 
to help us in making a precise prediction. 
 
Constructors like the above are commonly found in a strological literature. We talk 
about the 7 
th  lord giving marriage or a planet aspecting or occu pying 7 th  or 7 th  lord. 
Or a planet having an argala on 7 th  or 7 th  lord. If it is still not enough, we can add the 
nakshatra lord of 7 th  lord or his dispositor or someone else. As we add conditions, we 
finally cover all the planets. We can always explai n the known past this way. Of 
course, if we have a standard procedure for finding  the strongest candidate among all 
those planets and if his dasa always gives the resu lts, then it is logical. But, if there 
are 6 candidates and we explain an event by simply showing the candidacy of the 

--- Page 457 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 445  
 
planet involved, it is irrational. We are in troubl e when making predictions about 
future in that approach – which of the umpteen candidates will give the result? 
 
The root cause of the problem is that we often use the wrong tool to analyze a matter. 
Sages explained hundreds of dasa systems and yet we  use only a handful. When we 
use the correct technique, probably the strongest c andidate gives the result. When we 
use a wrong technique, we are forced to give a vague justification. 
 
For example, we saw in Example 58 that Mercury (8 
th  lord in 7 th ) and Rahu (malefic 
in 2 nd ) were the strongest killer planets. By taking a va riation of Vimsottari dasa that 
starts from the 8 th  star from Moon’s star, we found that the native pa ssed away in 
Rahu’s antardasa in Mercury’s dasa. However, one re lying on standard Vimsottari 
dasa always will find that Venus dasa is running an d he will explain the event based 
on the situation of Venus in the 7 th  house. But, if we take yogakaraka Venus to be a 
maraka because he is in the 7 th  house, we can take 6 planets (occupants and lords of 
2nd  and 7 th ) as marakas. With 6 planets out of 9 qualifying as  marakas, how can we 
predict when the native passes away? On the other h and, by using the most 
appropriate dasa, we see that the event was given by the strongest candidates. 
 
Because of the corruption in astrological knowledge , many contemporary astrologers 
don’t use the most appropriate techniques always. D ue to this, they have to deal with 
a lot of vagueness and they rely on spiritual stren gth for correct predictions. When 
explaining the past, a vague principle is fine. But  predicting the future becomes 
difficult. One needs luck or spiritual strength. 
 
33.4  Probability Analysis 92  
 
The point made above can be expressed mathematicall y. Let us say that event A 
denotes the occurrence (satisfying) of an astrologi cal combination. Let us say that 
event B denotes the occurrence of an event. Let us say that we want to correlate and 
link A with B. For example, event A can be “Venus t ransits in a trine from the 7 
th  
house” and event B can be “the native gets married”. 
 
                                                
 
92  Some knowledge of the probability theory will be a ssumed in this discussion. Readers can refer to 
standard high school/college mathematics textbooks. 

--- Page 458 ---
  
 
 446 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Now the conditional probability P(A|B) denotes the probability (or chance) that A 
occurs, given that B occurred, i.e.  the chance that the combination is satisfied given  
that one gets married. 
 
And P(B|A) denotes the probability (or chance) that  B occurs, given that A occurred, 
i.e.  the chance that one gets married given the combination is satisfied. 
 
The two are different. When making predictions in r eal life, we are concerned with 
P(B|A). However, when explaining a known event in a  book, we are concerned with 
P(A|B). If A is a large composite of many small con ditions joined by “or” ( e.g.  
Venus trnasits in a trine from the 7 
th  house or Jupiter aspects UL in transit or dasa of 
UL lord runs or dasa of 7 th  lord runs), we maximize P(A|B). In other words, A is 
satisfied in most charts when B (marriage) occurs. So we think that A is an excellent 
principle with a good correlation with event B. However, making A very large makes 
P(B|A) very low and we can’t predict B just because A occurred. 
 
So we should stop unduly worrying about P(A|B) and we should worry more about 
P(B|A). High P(A|B) helps us in giving nice example s in books. It doesn’t help us in 
predictions. We should not make our principles vagu e combinations of many 
components ( e.g.  if combinations x or y or z or w or v or u is sati sfied, then event B 
occurs). We should always identify the strongest ca ndidate to give an event. If an 
event is given by one of the six or seven weak cand idates, we should reject the logic 
and search for an alternative technique in which th e event is given by the best 
candidate. Only with an uncompromising rational app roach and dedicated research 
into the teachings of great Sages can we ever appreciate the subject of astrology in its 
fullest glory. 
 
33.5  Statistical Research 
 
When we come across an astrological principle, we c an evaluate its worth using 
statistical research. We can take as many examples as we can and find out in what 
percentage of examples the principle is satisfied. Sometimes the result attributed to 
an astrological combination may be vague and subjec tive. But sometimes, we have 
clearly defined events as results and we can use statistical research in such cases. 
 
Example 136: Suppose we want to evaluate the principle: “one ge ts married when 
the dasa and the antardasa as per Navamsa Narayana dasa belong to one of the four – 

--- Page 459 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 447  
 
lagna, upapada, 3 rd  from upapada and 8 th  from upapada”. It is clearly defined. We 
can take 200 charts of married people and find the dasa and the antardasa running at 
the time of marriage. We can find the number of cha rts in which both dasa and 
antardasa belong to the 4 signs mentioned. Suppose the number of such charts is 90. 
So the success rate of the principle is 90 x100/200 = 45%. 
 
This means that the predictions made just using thi s principle will not have 100% 
success. However, the question is — is 45% good enough for this principle or not? 
 
Assuming that there is really no correlation betwee n getting married and this 
combination, we can find the expected success rate.  If the real success rate is 
considerably higher, it means that there is a corre lation. It will become clearer after 
we make some calculations. 
 
Suppose there is no correlation between the above c ombination and getting married. 
Then let us find the probability of the dasa and th e antardasa being one of the four 
signs on a random date. We have 4 signs. To maximiz e this probability ( i.e.  go to the 
worst case), let us say that lagna is not in the sa me sign as UL or the 3 
rd /8 th  from UL. 
So we have 4 signs out of 12. The probability that the dasa on any day belongs to 
these 4 signs is 4/12=1/3. Similarly, the probabili ty that the antardasa on any day 
belongs to these 4 signs is 4/12=1/3. These two eve nts are independent and the 
probability that the dasa and the antardasa on any day belong to these 4 signs is  
(1/3) x( 1/3) = 1/9. Expressed as a percentage, this is 11%. 
 
What this means is — if we find the dasa and the an tardasa on any day, both belong 
to lagna or the 1 
st , 3 rd  or 8 th  from UL in only 11% cases on average. However, if the 
dasa and the antardasa on the day of marriage belong to these 4 signs in 45% cases, it 
is 4 times the exepected success rate. That clearly  shows that there is a link between 
the combination and marriage. This shows a statistically significant correlation. 
 
Analysis as above does not directly help us in maki ng predictions, but it helps us in 
validating atleast a part of astrology as a probabi listic science. Astrology researchers 
who have the resources and skills should intelligen tly formulate well-defined 
principles, test them statistically and find the su ccess rate and compare it with the 
expected success rate as above. Instead of lamentin g the rejection of astrology by the 
scientific community, we should engage in this exercise and convince ourselves first.

This author is confident that exercises like this will establish parts of Vedic astrology 
as a science in the coming decades. Such statistica l studies were conducted by some 
scientists and western astrologers in the past, but  those people did not use the right 
factors. They did not have a proper grounding in se rious Vedic astrology. Divisions, 
houses, arudhas, argalas, multiple dasas etc will enable us to conduct more 
meaningful and fruitive statistical research. Fuzzy logic theory will also be helpful. 
 
Exercise 52: Suppose we evaluate the principle: “Chara dasa of a rasi occupied or 
aspected by the 3 rd  house or a rasi occupied or aspected by the 3 rd  lord or a rasi 
occupied or aspected by BK results in the birth of a brother”. Suppose it is correct in 
75% charts we examine. Evaluate the worth of this principle. 
[HINT : If events A, B and C are independent, P(A or B or  C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) – 
P(A).P(B) – P(B).P(C) – P(C).P(A) + P(A).P(B).P(C)] 
 
33.6  Why Astrology Works 
 
While we discuss rational thinking, we may as well address this most asked question: 
“Why does astrology work? How can planets have an i mpact on us? Isn’t it irrational 
to think they do?” 
 
Unfortunately we don’t know exactly why planets influence us. We may not find that 
out in near future. Nevertheless, the subject of as trology becomes valid and justified 
if we prove some correlations statistically. Even i f we cannot explain why planets 
influence us, we can still study the correlations b etween planetary motion and events 
in our lives. While it will be nice to be able to a nswer the fundamental question 
raised above, it is not necessary for astrology to be accepted as a statistical science. 
Some pseudorational people argue that astrology can not be a science as long as we 
cannot explain why planets influence us. But that is not logical. 
 
Sometimes we cannot explain new observations on the  basis of old models and we 
have to come up with new theories and postulates. We may not be able to explain the 
influence of planets on us on the basis of the scie ntific model of the universe we 
have today. But that does not trivialize the statis tical study of the correlations 
between planetary combinations and events in the lives of individuals.

33.7  Conclusion 
 
Many astrologers lament the fact astrology is not a ccepted as a science. But they do 
not realize that a lot needs to be done before astr ology is accepted as a science. A 
few common problems are discussed in this chapter. It is this author’s hope that 
atleast some readers are motivated to evaluate astr ology using the tools given by 
modern science. Spirituality, respect for Sages and scientific temper can co-exist. 
 
33.8  Answers to Eexrcises 
 
Exercise 52: 
 
Let event A be: “dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3 
rd  house”. Let event B be: 
“dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3 rd  lord”. Let event C be: “dasa rasi is occupied 
or aspected by BK”. A rasi is aspected by 3 rasis ( by rasi aspect). So P(A), P(B) and 
P(C) are all equal to 4/12=1/3 here. 
 
So the combined probability is (1/3)+(1/3)+(1/3)–(1 /9)–(1/9)–(1/9)+(1/27) = 19/27 
or 70%. Though 75% is higher than 70%, it is not co nsiderably higher. So there isn’t 
any statistically significant correlation. 
 
[Basically, combinations that are satisfied in 70% cases on average are poor 
candidates for our studies. Even if the combination  is satisfied in 90% of the cases 
when the event occurred, we cannot correlate the co mbination with the event with 
confidence. On the other hand, if a combination is satisfied only in 5% cases on 
average, we can suggest a good correlation even if the combination is satisfied in 
25% cases when the event occurred. Because 25 is 5 times 5, there is a strong 
correlation between the combination and the event in that case.]

34.  Remedial Measures 
 
34.1  Introduction 
 
After stressing the importance of rational thinking  in astrological analysis, let us 
come to an important topic that has no rational exp lanation. Those who have no  
belief in Vedic remedies may skip this chapter . 
 
An expert astrologer may be able to predict bad tim es and setbacks successfully. But 
what good is it for, if something cannot be done to  avert the setbacks and bad times? 
A doctor not only identifies the disease one is suf fering from, but prescribes drugs to 
cure it. Can we do the same thing in astrology? 
 
In this chapter, we will take a look at remedial me asures. Remedial measures are the 
measures that are taken to remedy the unfortunate s ituations that a native is going 
through or is expected to go through. 
 
The pattern to be followed by one’s life is decided at the time of one’s birth by the of 
planetary position then, which is in turn decided b y the karma (actions) accumulated 
in past lives. However, it only decides the basic ‘ pattern’ and not all the minute 
details. Though the basic pattern cannot be easily altered, the exact details can be 
altered by exercising free will. For example, one m ay be destined to have a vehicular 
accident on a particular day, but it can be a minor  accident or a major one. Actions 
taken by one’s free will have a role, along with th e accumulated actions (karma) of 
past lives, in deciding the exact details. Remedial  measures are the measures we take 
in order to manipulate the exact details to be relatively favorable to us. 
 
34.1.1  Common-sense Remedies 
 
When we anticipate good happenings, we can afford t o take a few risks. On the other 
hand, we can take extra precautions when we anticip ate bad happenings. If an 
accident is possible in a period, we can drive very  carefully or even avoid travel if 
possible. If quarrels with authorities are possible  in a period, one can be extra careful 
and consciously try to restrain oneself. 

--- Page 463 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 451  
 
 
In this manner, we can take common sense precaution s to avert, or to reduce the 
impact of, the bad events anticipated. 
 
34.1.2  Pacifying Planets 
 
In Hinduism, we can remedy a bad result by the paci fication of planets. There are 4 
ways to make planets happy: 
 
(1)  Wearing a gemstone : This works only for planets that are favorable in  one’s 
horoscope. We can wear the gemstones of such planets to protect us. 
(2)  Good deeds : By committing good deeds, we can pacify planets. 
(3)  Planetary Propitiation : By reciting the mantras and stotras of planets, w e can 
pacify them. Mantra is a combination of sounds with  a special power to produce 
beneficial spiritual waves within us. Stotras are hymns in praise of planets. 
(4)  Propitiation of Deities : By propitiating various deities, we can pacify va rious 
planets. 
 
34.2  Gemstones 
 
One can wear the gemstones of favorable planets to get the blessings of those planets 
and tide over troubles. Look at the functional bene fics in one’s rasi chart and 
prescribe their gemstones. If a planet’s dasa is ru nning or if a planet is taking part in 
a favorable yoga, we may choose that planet. Wearin g the gemstone of a planet 
speeds up the fructification of the good results promised in a chart by that planet. 
 
If one wants good results in a particular area of l ife, we may strengthen favorable 
planets in the relevant divisional chart. For examp le, suppose someone wants 
improvement in career. We can prescribe the gemston e of a yogakaraka in D-10 
then. If a functional benefic is badly placed or we ak, its gemstone can still be used. 
For example, if one has lagna in Cp, Venus is a yog akaraka. Suppose Venus is in the 
8
th  house (Le). Then he may not give good results in h is dasa despite being a 
yogakaraka. In such a case, wearing diamond (gemsto ne of Venus) makes Venus 
powerful enough to give good results. On the other hand, gemstones of functional 
malefics in a chart should be avoided as far as pos sible. In addition, the gemstones of 

--- Page 464 ---
  
 
 452 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
marakas should be avoided when one is running marak a dasas. A list of the 
gemstones and metals of various planets are given i n Table 77. A ring made of the 
suggested metal with the suggested gemstone can be used for strengthening the 
planet. 
 
Table 77: Gemstones of planets 
Planet Gemstone Metal 
Sun Ruby Gold 
Moon White pearl Gold 
Mars Red coral Copper 
Mercury Emerald Silver/Platinum 
Jupiter Yellow sapphire Gold 
Venus Diamond Silver/Plantinum 
Saturn Blue sapphire Iron (or silver) 
Rahu Hessonite (gomedh) Silver 
Ketu Cat’s eye Silver 
 
The ring must be worn for the first time on the wee kday of the planet. The planetary 
strength should be good at that time. The planet ruling the gemstone should be strong 
at that time. 
 
We can combine two gemstones and wear them, if the corresponding planets are 
friends and functional benefics. This is partciular ly recommended when the two 
planets form a yoga. Suppose someone has lagna in V irgo. If 10 
th  lord Mercury and 
9th  lord Venus are together, they form dharma-karmadhi pati yoga. A ring consisting 
of emerald and diamond may be advised. Similarly, i f Sun and Moon conjoin in the 
chart of a person with Aries lagna, they form a raj a yoga and a ring with ruby and 
pearl may be recommended. 
 
Traditionally, astrologers assign the index finger to Jupiter, middle finger to Saturn, 
ring finger to Sun and little finger to Mercury. Tr aditionally, gemstones of Mercury 
and Venus are worn on the little finger; gemstone o f Saturn is worn on the middle 
finger and so on. However, some astrologers suggest  that the ring finger, middle 

--- Page 465 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 453  
 
finger, little finger and index finger show the fou r purushaarthas – dharma, artha, 
kama and moksha (respectively). They suggest wearin g a ring on the finger 
representing the purushaartha of interest. One desiring marriage may wear the ring of 
his 7 th  lord on the little finger. One desiring good resul ts in career may wear the ring 
of a yogakaraka in his D-10 on the middle finger an d so on. Index finger represents 
moksha and it is usually left ringless. 
 
34.3  Good Deeds 
 
One can pacify planets by good deeds. Good deeds of  this life can compensate for 
the sins of past lives. One can commit a good deed in an area ruled by a planet to 
please it. Some examples are listed below: 
 
To please Sun, one may go to a temple or donate mon ey to a temple or help in the 
administration of a temple. To please Moon, one may  donate money to a music 
institute or help a fair lady. To please Mars, one may engage in physical exercise or 
donate money to a school gym. To please Mercury, on e may donate money to an 
organization of scholars or get blessings from a sc holar. To please Jupiter, one may 
respect and donate money to a learned Brahmin or a priest. Or one may donate cows 
to a priest. To please Venus, one may read poetry o r help a poet. To please Saturn, 
one may perform some physical labor or help some people who live on manual labor. 
To please Rahu, one may donate some money to a rese arch organization or go on a 
pilgrimage. To please Ketu, one may do meditation. 
 
One can also give away (as charity) the grains ruled by different planets, to propitiate 
them. Sun rules wheat, Moon rules rice, Mars rules toor daal (a dark yellow lentil), 
Mercury rules moong daal (smaller yellow lentils of  a lighter shade – they have a 
dark green skin), Jupiter rules chick peas, Venus r ules a whitish grain, Saturn rules 
sesame seeds and Rahu rules black gram daal (white lentils with a black skin). For 
example, one can please Jupiter by giving away a bi g bowl of chick peas on a 
Thursday morning. 
 
Fasting is also a popular remedial measure. By puni shing ourselves by denying the 
basic necessity of food, we reduce other punishment s. Fasting on the weekday ruled 
by upapada lord in rasi chart, for example, mitigat es troubles in one’s marriage. 
Fasting on the weekday ruled by rajyapada lord may mitigate troubles in career.

 454 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
34.4  Propitiation of Planets 
 
We can propitiate planets by reciting mantras and s totras. Mantra is a combination of 
sounds with a special power to produce beneficial spiritual waves within us. 
 
A mantra should be recited with an accurate pronunc iation and intonation. Some 
mantras do not have any intonation, but the pronunc iation of sounds must be perfect. 
Some saattwik mantras are self-correcting, in the s ense that one reading it will 
eventually be forced to learn the correct pronuncia tion and intonation. Some other 
mantras can produce negative effects with improper recitation. So one should be 
careful with mantras. 
 
These days, people misuse the term “mantra” and ref er to many stotras as mantras. 
Stotras are hymns in praise of planets and God. The re is no correct intonation to read 
a stotra and devotion is important when reciting a stotra. Recitation of a stotra gives 
results very slowly. Interested readers can read th e 108 names of various planets 
everyday. As lagna is the most important house in a  chart and lagna lord shows the 
vitality of the chart, one may worship the planet o wning lagna in the divisional chart 
representing the area of life that one wants to imp rove. For example, if one wants 
spiritual progress, lagna lord in D-20 should be wo rshipped. If one wants pleasures 
and comforts, lagna lord in D-16 should be worshipped. 
 
There are different mantras for propitiating planet s. In addition, there are kavachas, 
stotras and 108 names of all planets. 
 
One popular mantra of each planet is listed below. One should read the stanza given 
first a few times and then repeat the basic mantra thousands of times. The 
recommended repitition count is also listed. The we ekday ruled by a planet is ideal 
for repeating its mantra. 
 
N
OTE : The stanzas and mantras are being given only in Devanagari script  used by 
Sanskrit and Hindi languages. Those who cannot read  this script should consult a 
competent astrologer or a Hindu priest to learn the se stanzas and mantras. This may 
cause an inconvenience to non-Indian readers of thi s book, but the purpose is to 
discourage mis-pronunciation. Giving an approximate  transliteration in the Roman 
script can only encourage mistakes.

There are many other mantras and one can refer to o ther books for the details. When 
reading a stotra, devotion is of utmost importance.  When reading a mantra, devotion 
as well as the correct pronunciation are important. 
 
34.5  Propitiation of Deities 
 
Instead of propitiating planets directly, we can pr opitiate the ruling deities. 
Propitiating the deity corresponding to lagna lord in a particular divisional chart 
brings excellent results in the area of life shown by divisional chart. Propitiation of 
the deity corresponding to the strongest planet occ upying or owning or aspecting the 
12 
th  house from AK in D-9 takes one’s soul closer to liberation.

Table 78: Planets and deities 
Planet Deity 
Sun Shiva, Rama 
Moon Gauri, Lalita, Saraswati, Krishna 
Mars Hanuman, Rudra, Kartikeya 
(Subrahmanya), Narasimha 
Mercury Vishnu, Narayana, Buddha 
Jupiter Hayagreeva, Vishnu, Parameswara, 
Dattatreya, Any guru 
Venus Lakshmi, Parvati 
Saturn Vishnu, Brahma 
Rahu Durga, Narasimha 
Ketu Ganesa 
 
A list of commonly suggested deities for each plane t is given in Table 78. “Prasna 
marga” gives some additional deities. Elders also i ntuitively prescribe deities based 
on the particular planetary combination in a chart.  For example, Mercury and Saturn 
usually denote a Vaishnava deity. Sun denotes a Sha iva deity. Moon and Venus 
denote a goddess. Mars denotes a fiery form. Rahu d enotes an aggressive deity. 
Based on the planetary combinations in a chart, we can choose the right deity. 
 
For example, let us say we need to please Rahu in a  chart. Let us say Mars and Rahu 
are in Ge, with Saturn and Mercury aspecting them. Rahu can denote Durga, but 
Saturnine and Mercurian influence suggests a Vaishn ava deity. Martian influence on 
Rahu shows an angry deity. So “Ugra Narasimha”, an angry form of Vishnu, may be 
worshipped to please Rahu. Rahu in Cancer may denot e Durga in another chart. In 
another example, Mars may be in a fiery rasi in all  vargas and Mercury may join him 
and it may show “Jwala Narasimha”. Mars with Rahu ( serpent) may show 
Subrahmanya (Kartikeya) in another chart. Mars with  Saturnine influence may show 
Hanuman, as Saturn shows a Vaishnava deity and he h as humility and the spirit of a 
servant. 
 
The guidelines given in books are merely guidelines . The exact application depends 
on an astrologer’s knowledge of mythology and class ics and familiarity with the 
natures of various deities. By propitiating a deity  who closely represents the spirit of 
a planet in a particular chart, one can please the planet more effectively.

This book is only an introductory textbook of integ rated Vedic astrology. While an 
effort is made to cover a variety of topics, no top ic has been covered exhaustively. 
The coverage of the topics in the current part (“Sp ecial Topics”) is particularly brief. 
The purpose of this part is just to make the reader s familiar with some practical 
aspects of Vedic astrology. Readers should refer to  other books for more details on 
these topics. Readers may take advantage of “Vedic Remedies in Astrology” by Pt.

35.  Mundane Astrology 
 
35.1  Introduction 
 
In this book, we have so far concentrated on predic ting the fortune of individual 
human beings based on their birthcharts. We sometimes have to predict the collective 
fortune of large groups of people. An example is th e fortune of a nation. To predict 
the fortune of a nation, we can use the birthchart of the leader of the nation, the 
swearing-in chart of the leader and the birthchart of the nation, if available. When 
these are not available, we can use lunar and solar  new year charts and new month 
charts. Solar charts are good at showing some matte rs and lunar charts are good at 
showing some other matters. There are also some tec hniques based on transits. We 
can map different nations to different rasis and co nstellations and take transits with 
respect to those rasis and constellations. This approach needs a lot of further research 
and it is beyond the scope of this textbook. 
 
Study of the collective fortune of groups of people  using planetary charts is called 
“mundane astrology” and birthcharts of nations, swe aring-in charts, lunar charts, 
solar charts and other charts used in mundane astro logy are known as “mundane 
charts”. 
 
35.2  Re-interpreted Significations 
 
In mundane charts, we can still use arudha padas, d ivisional charts etc , but we have 
to re-interpret the significations of various chart s, houses and arudha padas 
judiciously. For example, D-9 may show relations wi th other nations and the role 
played in international polity. D-30 may show inter nal disturbances and violence. D-
11 may show wars and terrorist activities. D-8 may show unexpected and sudden 
external troubles like natural calamities. D-10 may  show political activity. D-24 may 
show universities, science, technology, arts, resea rch and activities of intelligentsia. 
Arudha lagna may show how a nation is perceived in the world. A3 may shows its 
weapons. A6 may shows its enemies. A7 may show its allies. Significations of 
various houses are given below: 
 

--- Page 473 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 461  
 
First house: General state of affairs in the nation, public health, cabinet. 
 
Second house: State revenue, wealth, imports, commerce, allies, aristocracy. 
 
Third house: Telecommunications, transportation, journalism, media. 
 
Fourth house: Educational institutions, students, real estate, ge neral feeling of well-
being, trade, agriculture. 
 
Fifth house: Children, new births, crime, parks, mentality of leaders. 
 
Sixth house: State loans, debt, diseases, armed forces, territorial attacks. 
 
Seventh house: Health of women, immorality, infant mortality, war,  relations with 
other nations. 
 
Eighth house: Death rate, state treasury, unexpected troubles, instability. 
 
Ninth house: Temples, righteousness, judiciary, fortune. 
 
Tenth house: The ruler, politics, parliament, foreign trade, exp orts, revolution and 
political instability. 
 
Eleventh house: Gains from other nations, gains in trade, friendship. 
 
Twelfth house: Secret enemies, plots, secret crime, hospitals, wars, losses. 
 
35.3  Using Birthcharts 
 
When a new leader takes command of a nation, it sig nals a new beginning for the 
nation and hence the chart cast for the moment of s wearing-in is important. 
However, the beginning of a new order  is more important than the beginning of a 
new command . When a nation re-organizes itself based on new ph ilosophies and 
thought, it signals the beginning of a new order. C hart cast for the beginning of a 
new order is more important than a swearing-in chart. 
 

--- Page 474 ---
  
 
 462 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
For example, the nation of India existed for more t han 5,000 years. However, it took 
a new identity when it won independence on 15 th  August 1947. The independence 
chart of India shows the beginning of a new order i n India. Though several princely 
states joined India after her independence, there w as no major change in the identity 
of India. When India formed its constitution and de clared itself a Sovereign 
Replublic on 26 th  January 1950, its identity was only consolidated and not changed . 
So the independence chart (15 th  August 1947, midnight, Delhi) is the birthchart of  
India and it is the most important one for predicting India’s fortune. 
 
We can use Vimsottari dasa as well as Narayana dasa  with a nation’s birthchart. An 
example of the interpretation of Narayana dasa for a nation was given in Example 
69. Another technique prominently used with the birthcharts of nations is Tajaka. We 
can cast Tajaka annual charts to predict the fortun e of a nation in a year and use it 
with Sudarsana Chakra dasa 
93 . 
 
Example 137: Let us consider India’s independence chart and Tajaka annual chart of 
1997-98 (see Chart 80). India surprised the interna tional community by conducting a 
series of nuclear tests in May 1998. Let us look at  D-24 (the chart of technology and 
research) and find Tajaka annual chart and Sudarsana Chakra dasa. 
 
In natal D-24, lagna in Cp is stronger than Moon an d Sun. In 1997, India finished 50 
years and started the 51 
st  year. We get 3 by subtracting multiples of 12 from  51. So 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa of the 3 rd  house runs in the year. So dasa belongs to Pi 94 . We 
should cast the annual chart when the 51 st  year starts and judge the chart w.r.t. Pi. 
 
The most prominent placement is that Sun, Rahu and Ketu are in the 3 
rd  house from 
Pi. This makes the 3 rd  house very strong and activities related to aggres sive wepon 
development make sense. Situation of exalted Mars i n the 11 th  house with two other 
planets is also favorable for technical growth. How ever, the presence of debilitated 
Venus in the 7 th  house from Pi may have resulted in bad relations w ith other nations 
in technical matters. After the nuclear tests, a lo t of curbs were imposed by the 
western world on Indian institutions of science and technology. 
                                                 
93  Sudarsana Chakra dasa and Tajaka annual charts are  treated this book as two closely linked topics. 
When we say that Tajaka annual charts should be use d, we automatically mean that Sudarsana Chakra 
dasa should be used. 
94  We can also say that muntha is in Pi in D-24.

35.4  Lunar charts 
 
When Sun and Moon have an exact conjunction in ever y sign, it starts a new lunar 
month. When Sun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, it star ts a new lunar year. We can 
cast a chart at the exact moment of Sun-Moon conjun ction at the capital of a country 
and use it to predict the fortune of the nation in the upcoming month or year. We can 
use rasi chart as well as divisional charts. For ti ming events, we can compress 
Vimsottari dasa from 120 years to a lunar month or a lunar year. To compress 
Vimsottari dasa, follow this procedure: 
 
(1)  Find the constellation occupied by Moon and find its lord. His dasa comes first. 
(2)  If we are compressing from 120 years to 360 days (a pproximately a lunar year), 
each year is compressed to 3 days. So Sun dasa beco mes 18 days, Moon dasa 
becomes 30 days and so on. If we are compressing fr om 120 years to 30 days 
(approximately a lunar month), 1 year becomes 0.25 days. So Sun dasa becomes 
1.5 days, Moon dasa becomes 2.5 days and so on. 
(3)  We do not take the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon and decide the 
remainder in first dasa based on that. We get better results by letting the complete 
duration of the first dasa come together. If Moon i s in Sun’s constellation in a 
lunar new year chart, Sun dasa runs for the first 18 days. 
(4)  Go through the nine dasas in the same order as in V imsottari dasa computed for 
natal charts. The only difference is that the dasas  are compressed as mentioned 
above. 
 
We can see the general well-being of a nation, rest lessness of people, revolutions, 
trade, wealth, mood of the nation, weather, natural calamiities etc in lunar charts. 
 
Example 138: Let us take the 1992-93 lunar new year chart of In dia (see Chart 81). 
In early December 1992, India was shaken by communa l clashes in the aftermath of 
the demolition of Babri Mosque in Ayodhya 
95 . 
 
                                                
 
95  Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama. According to a group of Indian scholars, Babri mosque 
was originally a temple of Lord Rama in the sacred city and Muslim invader Babar converted it to a 
mosque a few centuries ago. A political party wante d a Rama temple there. Though the mosque was 
unused for a long time, its demolition was unaccept able to Muslim leaders. Against court orders, 
activists of that party demolished the mosque in ea rly December 1992 and it led to communal 
violence in different parts of India.

Chart 81 
 
 
Sun and Moon had a conjunction at 19 Pi 57 on 3 
rd  April 1992 at 10:32 am (IST). 
We cast a chart at New Delhi at that time and call that India’s lunar new year chart 
for 1992-93. 

--- Page 478 ---

We can see that the lagna-7
th  axis has Ketu and Rahu. Rahu’s aspect on lagna can  
affect the general well-being of the nation and cre ate turbulence. This can happen in 
Rahu dasa. It may be noted that Mercury dasa runs f irst in this chart and Rahu dasa 
runs in early December. With Rahu owning the 9 th  house, it had to do with religious 
places. 
 
In addition to rasi chart, we can look at D-30. It shows the subconscious forces 
playing  a role in a native’s actions and his sins.  In the case of a nation, it can show 
internal turbulences, violence, riots etc . In D-30 (see Chart 81), Mars, Rahu and Ketu 
afflict the 9 
th  lord Jupiter in the 9 th  house. Again, this supports communal violence in 
Rahu’s periods. 
 
35.5  Solar charts 
 
When Sun enters a rasi, it starts a new solar month . We can cast a chart for that 
moment and analyze the fortune of a nation during t he solar month. In particular, 
charts cast when Sun enters the movable signs (Ar, Cn, Li and Cp) are important and 
they are used by some astrologers to predict a nati on’s fortune during a 3-month 
period. 
 
We can cast the solar new year chart when Sun enter s Aries, the first sign of the 
zodiac. This solar new year is celebrated in some p arts of India. A chart cast at a 
nation’s capital when Sun enters Aries can be used for predicting the nation’s fortune 
for one year. 
 
However, some astrologers prefer to use the chart w hen Sun enters Cp for predicting 
the fortune for a year. They consider the solar ing ress into Capricorn 
96  to be the most 
important solar chart in Kali Yuga. 
 
Solar charts are good at showing political activity , wars, vitality of a nation, 
international relations, commerce etc . Narayana dasa and other rasi dasas can be 
compressed to one year (as in Tajaka charts) and us ed with solar charts. They give 
better results than Vimsottari dasa in the case of solar charts. 
 
                                                
 
96  This is celebrated in south India as “Makara Sankraanthi” or “Makara Sankramanam” or “Pongal”.

Example 139:  Let us consider Sun’s Capricorn ingress chart of 1 998, erected at 
India’s capital. India conducted nuclear tests in M ay 1998. Let us consider D-24 (see 
Chart 82). 
Chart 82 
 
 
D-24 shows activities related to learning, science and technology. Scorpio is the 8 
th  
rasi in the natural zodiac and it shows hidden thin gs. The 3 rd  house in D-24 shows 
weapons and aggressive technology. Rahu and Ketu in  the 3 rd  house in Scorpio in D-
24 of the solar new year chart suggest hidden activ ities related to aggressive weapon 
development technology. Lagna lord Mercury is in th e 6 th  house and he shows 
enmity and poor relations with other nations in the  matters of knowledge. This along 
with the debilitation of Venus can explain India’s isolation in the scientific world 
following the nuclear tests.

35.6  Swearing-in Charts 
 
We can cast a chart when a new leader (the chief of  the executive wing of 
government) is sworn-in in a nation. That chart als o has an impact on the nature of 
results experienced by the nation during the leader ’s tenure. We can find Narayana 
dasa of rasi chart and divisional charts of the swe aring-in ceremony. We have to 
compress Narayana dasa from 120 years to the expect ed maximum length of the 
tenure. 
 
Example 140:  Let us take Indian Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpaye e’s swearing-in 
ceremony of March 19, 1998. Let us study D-9 and lo ok at the relations with other 
nations (Chart 83). 
Chart 83 
 
 
An Indian Prime Minister’s tenure can be a maximum of 5 years. If we compress 120 
years of Narayana dasa to 5 years = 60 months, i.e.  compress each year to half a 
month, we get dasas as given below: 

--- Page 481 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 469  
 
 
Aq (06 years):  Mar 1998 - Jun 1998 
Cn (10 years):  Jun 1998 - Nov 1998 
Sg (02 years):  Nov 1998 - Dec 1998 
Ta (01 years):  Dec 1998 - Jan 1999 
Li (08 years):  Jan 1999 - May 1999 
Pi (01 years):  May 1999 - May 1999 
Le (12 years):  May 1999 - Nov 1999 
 
With Cn being the 6 
th  house, its dasa brought bad relations with other n ations. India 
was isolated in the international community after t he nuclear tests. Li is the 9 th  house 
and it shows good diplomacy and excellent relations  in navamsa. Its lord Venus is in 
a trine. So Libra dasa saw Vajpayee promoting peace with a nation shown by Libra – 
Pakistan – and the Lahore bus trip materialized in Li dasa. 
 
About Le dasa, the following was written by this author in a magazine article 
97 : 
 
“Leo dasa of six months will run from May 19, 1999.  Leo has 
unobstructed argalas from two diplomatic planets – Moon and Venus. Leo 
is the 7 th  house and it contains Sun and Rahu. Rahu's presenc e may 
indicate unpleasant confrontation with some countri es, but Sun is very 
strong in own house. This means that India's voice may be heard with 
attention and India's point of view may be respecte d in international fora 
during this period. The international community may  respect the bold 
stand taken by Vajpayee government regarding variou s thorny issues that 
may plague the world during the next few months. 
 
As per Narayana dasa of Rudramsa (D-11), six-month Scorpio dasa started 
on Mar 19, 1999. Lagna in D-11 here is in Aries and  Scorpio (8 
th  house) 
contains Mars and Ketu (see chart 6). This could br ing fresh troubles from 
terrorism.” 
 
India was dismayed to find foreign mercenaries, Pak istani soldiers and terrorists on 
some mountains on the Indian side of LoC 
98  and surprised Pakistan on May 25, 1999 
by boldly launching air strikes. Later India launch ed a ground offensive also. India’s 
stand received excellent support and respect from t he international community. After

35.7  Conclusion 
 
When we have the birthdata of a nation, we can use its birthchart. By the birth of a 
nation, we mean the start of a new order and the re cognition of a new national 
identity. We can cast charts at a nation’s capital when a new solar or lunar year or 
month starts and use them to predict the fortune of a nation during the year or month. 
 
Lunar new year charts are free from errors due to a yanamsa. However, solar new 
year charts are prone to heavy errors if ayanamsa i s erroneous. If ayanamsa has an 
error of 1 arc-minute, this results in an error of 360 arc-minutes ( i.e.  6º!) in lagna of 
the solar new year chart. This is because lagna moves 360 times as fast as Sun. In the 
time Sun takes to move by an angle of 
θ, lagna moves by an angle of (360 xθ). So the 
divisional charts of solar new year charts will not  give consistent results until our 
ayanamsa is exact. It is not wise to assume that th e ayanamsa one uses is perfect and 
free from any error. 
 
One last word — The purpose of this small chapter i s only to introduce  mundane 
astrology to readers. Interested readers may refer to the writings on mundane 
astrology by great authors such as Varahamihira and  Dr.B.V.Raman. This chapter 
should only be a starting point.

36.  Muhurta or Electional Astrology 
 
36.1  Introduction 
 
When a person is born, the planetary position at th at time decides how his/her life 
progresses. Similarly, when a new task is freshly s tarted, the planetary position at 
that time decides how the task progresses. For exam ple, the planetary position  at the 
time one joins in a new job decides how one’s new j ob goes. The planetary position 
at the time one starts a new company decides the fo rtune of the company. The 
planetary position at the time of a wedding decides how the marriage goes. 
 
For this reason, believers choose an auspicious tim e when starting new ventures. The 
time when a new task is undertaken is called “muhur ta”. One can select a good 
muhurta for a variety of tasks – getting married, j oining a new job, swearing-in 
ceremonies (in the case of political leaders), star ting a new company, starting a kid’s 
formal education, giving cooked rice to a baby for the first time, buying a vehicle, 
buying a house, housewarming, babyshowers etc . The list is endless. In India, old 
people choose a good muhurta even for getting a haircut or for cutting nails. 
 
The topic of muhurta has a lot of controversies. Di fferent guidelines are given in 
different classics and different conventions are in  vogue in different regions of India. 
Out of the modern books on muhurta in English langu age, the one by Dr. B.V. 
Raman is very good. 
 
36.2  Definition of Muhurta 
 
Asrologers set nice muhurtas for the tasks of their  clients, but they don’t always 
verify that their clients know exactly what to do a t the time of the muhurta. For 
example, if we set an auspicious muhurta for someon e to join in a new job, what 
should he do at the time? Should he sign the job of fer letter? Or, should he sign the 
employment contract (if applicable)? Or, should he sit in front of his computer and 
power it on? Or, should he read a document describi ng the work he has to do? What 
exactly should one do at the time of the muhurta set for joining in a new job? 
 

--- Page 484 ---
  
 
 472 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
What is the definition of the time of marriage? Wha t is the definition of the time of 
joining in a new job? What is the definition of ent ering a new house? All these 
questions are not clearly answered in classics and we have to draw conclusions 
intelligently. 
 
Accepting a job offer is like conception. Starting the work is akin to a baby coming 
out of mother’s womb and starting to breathe on its  own. Depending on what one 
does in a job, we can decide what “starting the wor k” means. It is not enough to sign 
some papers, but one has to start some work at the time of a muhurta. In the case of a 
marriage, the purpose of marriage is living togethe r. Mangal sutra worn by a lady 
symbolizes it in Hindu culture. So the time when th e bridegroom ties the knot is the 
most appropriate. In the case of a Christian marriage, the time when the bride and the 
bridegroom are pronounced a man and a wife after sa ying “I do” may be the most 
appropriate time. In the case of entering a new hou se (housewarming), the correct 
time of entering the house is when one starts “livi ng” in the house. One may not start 
living in a house at the exact moment one enters a house with some suitcases. In the 
Hindu way of life, only a house where cooking is do ne is a place of living. So, 
traditionally, people warm milk on a stove at the t ime of muhurta. If milk is warmed 
for making sweet rice for offering Gods as a prasaa d, that symbolizes the starting of 
life in the house. We have to decide intelligently on a case by case basis. 
 
36.3  Basics of Muhurta 
 
Tithi, yoga, karana, weekday and nakshatra form the  5 limbs of “panchaanga” 
99 . 
When deciding a muhurta, we try to choose a good ti thi, weekday, yoga, karana, 
nakshatra and lagna. For each task, there are certa in tithis, weekdays, nakshatras and 
lagnas that are preferred. The nakshatra occupied b y Moon at the time of a muhurta 
should be a good tara with respect to janma nakshat ra. In addition, lord of the 
running hora (hour) should be a favorable planet in  the natal chart, especially with 
respect to the house to which the activity belongs.  For example, hora at the time of 
wedding should belong to a favorable planet in the natal chart with respect to the 7 th  
house and upapada. Hora at the time of moving to a new house should belong to a 
favorable planet in the natal chart with respect to  the 4 th  house and A4. If a planet 
owns the 8 th  house from the 4 th  house and occupies a badhaka sthana from A4, then it 
                                                 
99  Panchaanga means an almanac that lists auspicious and inauspicious times. It literally means “one 
with five limbs”.

may be disastrous to move into a new house in his h ora. Hora is a very important 
quantum of time.

A list of the common guidelines is given in Table 7 9. These are merely guidelines 
and not final recommendations. The recommendation i n the case of a wedding 
muhurta, for example, is to keep the 7 
th house empty. However, expert astrologers 
flout these norms often, with considerable success. 
 

--- Page 487 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 475  
 
The basic point in keeping the 7 th  house empty in a wedding muhurta is to avoid 
afflictions there. On the other hand, if the 7 th  house is occupied by benefics giving 
great yogas, how can that cause problems in marriage? 
 
Planetary strength is more important than strictly following these thumbrules. 
 
36.4  Planetary Strength 
 
Though a lot of thumbrules are given in literature,  an intelligent astrologer gives 
more importance to the strength of planets in the m uhurta chart than those 
thumbrules. Not only should the rasi chart be stron g, but also the concerned 
divisional chart should be strong. For example, for  joining a new job, lagna, 6 
th  
house and 10 th  house should be strong in rasi and D-10 charts. Wh en starting a 
child’s education, 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th  and 5 th  should be strong in rasi and D-24 charts. When 
buying a new vehicle, 1 st  and 4 th  houses (and A4) should be strong in rasi and D-16 
charts. When entering a new house, the 1 st  and 4 th  from lagna and Venus in D-4 
should be strong. When buying some real estate, the  1 st  and 4 th  from lagna and Mars 
in D-4 should be strong. 
 
We can use Vimsottari dasa to time the progress of a task started at a muhurta. If we 
know the maximum time period for which the task sta rted at a muhurta can last, we 
can compress Vimsottari dasa to that period. Details of the computation can be found 
in topic 35.4 in the chapter on “Mundane Astrology” . If the task started at a muhurta 
has no fixed time period of effect, we can take Vimsottari dasa of 120 years. 
 
In addition to planetary strength, we should ensure  that the first dasa as per 
Vimsottari dasa belongs to a favorable planet in th e chart. The effect of a muhurta 
lasts only for a few months or a couple of years an d the strength of one’s natal chart 
is more important in the long-run. So the first das a as per Vimsottari dasa is 
important. For example, we may select a muhurta with excellent rasi and D-10 charts 
for joining in a new job and yet bad results may be  experienced if the first dasa 
belongs to the 8 
th  lord in D-10. 
 
Example 141:  Let us consider the muhurta chart used by Sri A.B.  Vajpayee for 
swearing-in as India’s Prime Minister in May 1996 (see Chart 84). 
 

--- Page 488 ---

In rasi chart, lagna lord Sun is in 10 
th  and 10 th  lord Venus is in 11th. The 5 th  house is 
important for power and it contains its lord Jupite r. The 9 th  house of fortune is also 
very strong. On the whole, the chart is strong. Unf avorable sakuna karana was

running at the time. Chaturdasi tithi (14 th  lunar day) is usually not considered 
auspicious, but its ruler Venus owns the 10 th  house here and it is acceptable. Overall, 
rasi chart is acceptable. 
 
However, D-30 is weak. D-30 shows past and present evils and the punishment. To 
see an early death, it is an apt chart. Venus owns the 2 
nd  and 7 th  houses in D-30 here. 
He is a strong maraka (killer). He afflicts lagna. Lagna lord of rasi chart (Sun) is in 
the 2 nd  house in D-30. Because of these, there was a prema ture end. The fact that 
Venus dasa was running at muhurta – Moon was in a V enusian constellation – did 
not help either. Sri Vajpayee remained in power onl y for 13 days. However, the 
strength of rasi chart ensured his return within a couple of years. 
 
Example 142: Sri Vajpayee returned to power in March 1998. Let us consider the 
swearing-in muhurta used this time (see Chart 85). 
Chart 85 
 
 
Lagna lord is in 9 
th  with Uttamaamsa. Saturn owns 9 th  and 10 th  and he is in 11 th  with 
Uttamaamsa. The chart is basically strong. However,  3 rd  lord Moon is debilitated in 

--- Page 490 ---
  
 
 478 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
7th  and that is not conducive to a long life. Situation of Gulika within 1º from lagna is 
also undesirable. 
 
Because of the drawbacks, Sri Vajpayee lost the vot e of confidence in April 1999. 
However, the opposition parties could not offer an alternative and Vajpayee 
remained as the caretaker Prime Minister. The posit ion of his party improved in the 
October 1999 elections and he continued as PM. Let us time the setbacks of April 
1999 using Vimsottari dasa compressed to 5 years. W e can see that the 8 
th  
constellation Satabhisha falls in Aq and it is stro nger than Moon’s constellation, as 
Jupiter and Ketu occupy it. For matters related to longevity, we can use Vimsottari 
dasa started from the 8th constellation as it is st ronger. Using this dasa, Ketu 
antardasa in Jupiter dasa ran during April 3-17, 19 99. Venus antardasa ran for the 
next 40 days. With Jupiter owning the 8 th  house, Jupiter dasa was full of troubles. 
Ketu is the co-lord of the 7 th  house and he afflicts 8 th  lord. This resulted in the fall of 
the government. However, the next antardasa belonge d to lagna lord Venus, who is 
the lord of Sanjivani mantra 100 . So Sri Vajpayee wasn’t replaced by another leader  
and he remained as the caretaker PM. 
 
Example 143: Let us consider the muhurta at which this author s tarted writing this 
book (see Chart 86). Tithi is Saptami – an auspicio us tithi. Yoga is Vriddhi yoga 
(growth). Karana is Vanija. 
 
In rasi chart, lagna lord Moon occupies lagna in Paarijaataamsa. Lagna and Moon are 
in a constellation of Mercury, significator of writ ing. The 11 
th  house of gains has 
Venus in own sign in Gopuraamsa. The 10 th  house of karma (action) has exalted 2 nd  
lord Sun and 3 rd  lord Mercury. The 2 nd  house is important for astrological knowledge 
and the 3 rd  house shows writing. Both Sun and Mercury are in P aarijaataamsa. Lord 
of 10 th  house (Mars) is a yogakaraka here and he is in Gop uraamsa in the 2 nd  house. 
This parivartana (exchange of houses) between the 2 nd  and 10 th  lords is favorable for 
karma related to astrology. Jupiter is the signific ator of astrology and he has a close 
aspect on lagna and Moon. He aspects the 3 rd  house of writing also. 
 
However, Jupiter is debilitated. For an activity re lated to astrology, Jupiter’s 
debilitation is not good. The 3 
rd  house of writing has Rahu in it. Saturn owns the 8 th  
house and he aspects the 3 rd  house. Saturn’s aspect on the house of interest is  not

good. Aspect of the 8 th  lord is not good either. Rahu in 3 rd  also shows obstacles in 
writing. Then, why did this author choose this muhurta?

(1)  Lagna, 2 nd , 5 th , 10 th  and 11 th  are strong. The 3 rd  lord has a good placement, 
though 3 rd  is afflicted. 
(2)  Jupiter’s aspect is always good in astrological act ivities. If Jupiter is weak, it can 
denote initial setbacks. But Jupiter’s close aspect  on lagna and lagna lord can 
only be beneficial in the long run. 
(3)  Hora of Jupiter runs at the time of muhurta. Jupite r occupies the 2 nd  house of 
speech in this author’s natal chart. In his natal D -24, Jupiter occupies Pi (10 th  
house) and shows saattwik activities in society rel ated to fine knowledge. A3 is 
in Pi in natal D-10 and Jupiter owns it. From A3 in  D-24, he is the 2 nd  and 5 th  
lord and occupies the 5 th  house (in own rasi). So Jupiter’s hora is very fav orable 
for starting astrological writing. 
(4)  More importantly, the Navamsa chart is strong. 
 
If one’s aim in writing a textbook on Vedic astrology is to contribute to a renaissance 
in Vedic astrology and to serve astrology researche rs, then Navamsa is more 
important than Rasi. Navamsa is the chart that show s how one follows one’s dharma 
(duty). So the strength of Navamsa is very important. 
 
In navamsa (see Chart 86), lagna is in Pisces, a sa attwik sign owned by Jupiter. 
Jupiter aspects lagna from 7 
th . Navamsa lagna is in the 9 th  from Rasi lagna. Exalted 
3rd  lord Venus is in lagna and he owns the 11 th  house in Rasi chart. This is favorable 
to fulfilling one’s dharma related to writing. Merc ury occupies the 3 rd  house in 
Navamsa and he owns the 3 rd  house in Rasi. This again shows using good 
communication skills in fulfilling dharma. Mars is strong in the 9 th  house in own 
sign. The 9 th  house must be strong in Navamsa for a dharmik acti vity. Sun is in 10 th  
in both Rasi and Navamsa and that shows some recogn ition. Ketu is in the 5 th  house 
in Navamsa. This combination, if present in a natal  Navamsa, makes one good at 
mathematics as per Jaimini Maharshi. Here, this com bination makes an analytical 
approach possible. 
 
In the Rasi chart, Aries is an important rasi as it  contains 2 
nd  lord Sun and 3 rd  lord 
Mercury. Saturn, who owns the 8 th  house in this chart, was transiting in Aries durin g 
1998-2000. During this transit, progress wasn’t mad e. After Jupiter entered Aries, 
this author became determined to restart the projec t. In April 2000, Sun entered 
Aries, his muhurta position, and the project was re started with newfound vigor. Due 
to the presence of Mercury, Jupiter and Venus in Ar ies, May 2000 was a very 
productive period. After 3 years of contemplation a nd slow (no) progress, almost

 Part 5: Special Topics 481  
 
40% of this book was written in April-May 2000. Aft er Saturn left Aries, the other 
60% of this book was finished. 
 
As this example illustrates, we can use transits wi th muhurtas. Rasi is the chart of 
physical manifestation; navamsa is the chart of dha rma and inner self; and, dasamsa 
is the chart of achievements in society. So transit s with respect to Rasi chart are 
important in figuring out when the book is finished . Transits with respect to 
Navamsa chart are important in figuring out when an d whether the book serves its 
intended purpose. Transits with respect to Dasamsa chart are important in figuring 
out how the book is received and when and whether i t becomes popular. Thus we 
can adapt the meanings of divisional charts to muhurtas. 
 
36.5  Conclusion 
 
For standard principles related to muhurtas, reader s can refer to other books. In this 
book, the importance of analyzing planetary positio ns as in natal charts is 
emphasized, as many books leave out this important aspect. One should analyze the 
rasi and relevant divisional charts of a muhurta just as in the case of natal charts.

 482 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
37.  Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi 
 
 
Jyotisha is the Sanskrit name of Vedic astrology. O ne who practices Jyotisha is 
called a Jyotishi. Vedas are the sacred scriptures of Hinduism. Veda simply means 
“Knowledge”. Jyotisha is called a “Vedaanga” (a lim b of Vedas). In particular, 
Jyotisha is called the eye of Vedas. It is the scie nce of light and the eye of 
knowledge. 
 
To its believers, Vedic astrology is not just anoth er subject like mathematics and 
physics. It is considered a sacred subject. It give s its knower a special power to see 
the past, the present and the future. Such fine kno wledge cannot reach an 
irresponsible person. So Maharshis have set some gu idelines for the ethical behavior 
of Jyotishis. This author hopes that the readers of  this book abide by those 
guidelines. 
 
One should give this knowledge to worthy, honest an d god-fearing students who 
have great respect for their teacher and who speak truth always. In Indian culture, 
one’s relationship with a giver of knowledge is tha t of a servant with one’s master. 
Just as a servant obeys each command of his master,  a student obeys each command 
of his teacher. A wealthy man may give his servant only some money, but a teacher 
gives his students knowledge and knowledge is consi dered to be the most valuable 
asset in Indian culture. So teachers are treated wi th utmost respect. This may be 
tough to understand and appreciate, for readers fro m western cultures where 
knowledge is a commodity with a limited value. 
 
Maharshis advised that one benefits by teaching Jyotisha to god-fearing students who 
treat their teacher with utmost respect and speak t ruth. On the other hand, one 
becomes sad everyday by teaching Jyotisha to atheists, liars and deceitful people. 
 
In Kali Yuga, it may be difficult to find ideal stu dents for this subject. Nevertheless, 
one should not teach this subject to unwilling peop le and unbelievers. This 
knowledge should be given only to the worthy students. 
 
Jyotishis should also maintain dignity when offerin g astrological consultations. They 
should approach astrological consultations with the  spirit of service. They possess 

--- Page 495 ---
 
 
 Part 5: Special Topics 483  
 
special knowledge of a sacred subject and they shou ld help those who need 
guidance. Jyotishis should be spiritually oriented and they should realize that their 
knowledge is priceless. Instead of running after ma terial possessions, they should be 
happy with their knowledge and help people in need without expecting anything in 
return. 
 
Accumulating wealth and material possessions gives only temporary happiness. It 
may make one happy for 10 years or 50 years or 100 years. But when one dies and 
takes birth again, one loses all that. All these ma terial possessions cannot be carried 
with one. A greedy person will only struggle in the  infinite cycle of life, death and 
rebirth. Things can get only worse for a greedy person with each new life. 
 
Just as one who does not exercise accumulates a lot  of body fat which is a liability, a 
greedy person accumulates a lot of sin which become s a liability in the cycle of life, 
death and rebirth. On the other hand, an austere pe rson who punishes himself by 
denying comforts burns away the sins of past lives, just as one who troubles his body 
with regular exercise burns the body fat. So a wise  person doesn’t run after material 
possessions and tries to be austere. 
 
An austere Jyotishi who serves humanity with his/he r divine knowledge of Jyotisha 
burns away past sins and gets closer and closer to liberation from the cycle of life, 
death and rebirth. 
 
One should always be positive when making predictio ns. Negative predictions 
should be made with a restrained tone. A Jyotishi m ay gently caution the clients 
about an impending danger and suggest remedial meas ures and precautions, but he 
should not scare the clients. Negative predictions should be made only when some 
preventive action is suggested. Negative prediction s made just for fame or the 
sensation value bring unhappiness to the Jyotishi. Jyotishis should try to bring 
spiritual awareness in their clients and try to pro mote righteousness. Jyotisha should 
never be a business. It should be a spiritual service. 
 
With deep respect for my gurus and maharshis, I sha red my limited knowledge with 
the readers. May the readers of this book use the p rivileged knowledge of the divine 
subject of Jyotisha in the spirit of compassionate and selfless service and work for 
the uplifting of humanity!

Part 6:  Real-life 
Examples 
 
 
The “exercises” one encounters in real life can be considerably 
more complicated than the tailor-made exercises giv en in this 
book. The exercises given in this book familiarize the reader 
with various techniques, but making real-life predi ctions 
requires more than that. 
 
To illustrate the process of making predictions, so me real-life 
situations that this author faced in his experience  will be given. 
The process of synthesizing a prediction will be il lustrated in as 
much detail as possible. These examples are meant f or giving 
some guidance and inspiration to those who are new to the 
process of making predictions.

 Part 6: Real-life Examples 487 
 
  
 
Real-life Example 1:  
 
Birthdata of a lady is given in Chart 87. Her paren ts consulted the author in early 
1997 and wanted to know exactly when she would get married. 
 
For marriage, we should see rasi and navamsa charts  (see Chart 87). Vimsottari dasa 
of Jupiter started in mid-1996. Can Jupiter give ma rriage? Well, he must. Because 
this dasa started at an age of 23, it will run till  an age of 39. So Jupiter must give 
marriage. Being lagna lord in 11 
th , he can give all-round progress. Moreover, he 
aspects the 7 th  house Virgo and 7 th  lord Mercury here. So he can give marriage. 
 
Who is the 7 
th  lord? In rasi, 7 th  lord is Mercury. In D-9, 7 th  is in Cp and its lord 
Saturn aspects it from Sc. So Saturn antardasa can give marriage. When is it? It starts 
in the second half of 1998. But her parents already  started looking for a match and 
Saturn antardasa is too late. Can Jupiter antardasa  itself give marriage? It is not very 
likely. 
 
Where will Jupiter be in late 1998? He will be tran siting in Aq. Can Jupiter’s Aq 
transit give marriage? It doesn’t look too interest ing. Pi transit is a better candidate. 
As Pi is natal lagna, Jupiter’s Pi transit can brin g all-round progress. From Pi, Jupiter 
will aspect Vi, the 7 
th  house. He will also aspect Cn. Note that Cn contai ns 7 th  lord 
Mercury in rasi chart. In D-9, it contains lagna & Mercury. So Jupiter’s Pisces dasa 
in 1999 can bring marriage. 
 
The pratyantardasa running then is Mercury’s (Jan-M ay 1999). With Mercury 
owning the 7 
th  house in rasi and occupying lagna in D-9, his PD c an give marriage. 
He is also DK. 
 
To be sure, check Sudarsana Chakra dasa. On her birthday in 1998, she finishes 1998 
– 1973 = 25 years and starts the 26 
th  year. Subtracting multiples of 12 from 26, we 
get 2. So dasa of the 2 nd  house runs. In navamsa, it is Leo. At the time of the start of 
this dasa ( i.e.  Tajaka annual chart of 1998-99), Jupiter occupies Leo and Venus 
occupies Aquarius (see Chart 74). That is favorable . So marriage can take place in 
the year (1998-99).

 488 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
Chart 87 
 
 
In Tajaka annual chart, lagna lord and 2 
nd  lord have an exchange. The 2 nd  house 
shows family. Vivaha saham is in Sc. Mars owns it. Mars is also muntha lord. He has 
a very close ithasala with Venus, the natural signi ficator of marriage and upapada 
lord. In navamsa, Mars is very strong in his moolatrikona Aries. He is in the 2 nd  from 

--- Page 501 ---

lagna and 9 th  from muntha. Patyayini dasa of Venus runs during D ec 98 and Jan 99. 
Patyayini dasa of Mars runs during Feb-Mar 99. 
 
In 1999, the lunar month of Maagha ends in mid-Febr uary. It brings the season of 
marriages in India, because it is thought to be an auspicious month for marriages. So 
probably marriage will take place in that month. 
 
So the final prediction given was – “she may get ma rried in the first half of February 
1999”. Because upapada is in Li in rasi chart, she was advised to pray to goddess 
Lakshmi everyday and especially on Fridays. 
 
She got married at the end of Jan 1999 and went to USA with her husband in early 
Feb 1999. 
 
Real-life Example 2: 
 
A noted Vedic astrologer of the west was expecting a child in November 1999. At 
the end of October 1999, he mentioned on an interne t-based forum for Vedic 
astrology discussions 
101  that his child would be born in a few weeks. He di d not 
mention how many children he already had or what th e due date for this new child 
was. 
 
Later he expressed a desire on the forum to learn t he computation of Narayana dasa 
for divisional charts. This author wanted to illust rate the computation using the 
gentleman’s D-7, as he was expecting a child. His b irthdata and natal D-7 are given 
in Chart 88. 
 
Lagna in rasi chart is in Sc. The 7 
th  house is in Ta. Its lord is Venus. He is in Ge in 
D-7 and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas start from  Ge. Because Ge is a dual sign, 
we use the trinal progression of Vishnu. Because the 9 th  from Ge ( i.e.  Aq) is an even-
footed sign, we go backward. So dasas go as Ge, Aq,  Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar, Pi, 
Sc and Cn. It can be seen that Le dasa runs during 1988-2000. 
 
It can be seen that exalted Jupiter is stronger tha n lagna in D-7 and he can be used as 
a reference. The 1 
st , 2 nd  and 5 th  lords from him are Moon, Sun and Mars and they are

all conjoined in Leo. So Leo is a very important si gn in this D-7. Its dasa can give 
children. 
 
Chart 88 
 
 
Let us find antardasas. Because Le is stronger, ant ardasas start from its lord Sun. He 
is in Le, an odd sign. So antardasas go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc . During 1999-2000, the 
12 
th  antardasa of Cn runs. It contains exalted Jupiter and it can give a child. 
 
Pratyantardasas in Cn dasa start from Moon and agai n they go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc . 
March 13-April 13 is the first pratyantardasa. Octo ber 15-November 15 is the 8 
th  
pratyantardasa of Pisces. From November 15, Aries p ratyantardasa runs. Which is 
more likely to give a child? 
 
Pisces is the 11 
th  house and contains the 5 th  lord Mercury. Mercury is also PK. He is 
in a trine from exalted Jupiter. So Pisces pratyantardasa is more likely to give a child. 
 
Before it can be mentioned in public, it can be qui ckly cross-checked using the 
Tajaka annual chart of 1999-2000 (see Chart 89). 

--- Page 503 ---
 Part 6: Real-life Examples 491 
 
  
 
Chart 89 
 
 
In this chart, putra saham is in Cancer. Its lord M oon is in the 5 
th  house of children. 
He has a very close half-degree ithasala with lagna  lord Mercury. He also has an 
ithasala with Jupiter, natural significator of chil dren. In D-7, the 5 th  house is 

--- Page 504 ---
  
 
 492 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
occupied by Mercury and Jupiter. Moon owns lagna an d occupies 3 rd  (11 th  from 5 th , 
showing the gain of a child). 
 
All these factors suggest a child in the dasa of Mo on, who emerges as an important 
planet in rasi and D-7. However, Moon’s dasa comes during June-July. Lagna’s 
Patyayini dasa runs during Oct 29-Nov 23 and Sun’s dasa comes after it. This 
gentleman said on Oct 29 that he was expecting a ch ild in a few weeks. So it has to 
be either lagna’s dasa or Sun’s dasa. Compared to S un dasa, lagna’s dasa is a better 
candidate. Usually lagna’s dasa brings important re sults. Antardasa is likely to be 
Moon’s. Moon’s antardasa runs on Nov 14-15. This ag rees with the indication from 
D-7 Narayana dasa, viz  child-birth before Nov 15. 
 
After this analysis, an e-mail was sent to the foru m giving the computation of the 
gentleman’s D-7 Narayana dasa. It was mentioned tha t he might get a child before 
November 15. 
 
The gentleman clarified later that the date given b y doctors was November 23. He 
said that it was the third child and the ultra-soun d scan predicted a daughter. The 3 
rd  
child is shown by the 9 th  lord in D-7. Debilitated Mercury is the 9 th  lord from lagna 
in D-7 (counted in reverse). Debilitated planets sh ow a daughter. Mercury also 
shows a daughter. We can now be more confident abou t child-birth in the 
pratyantardasa of Pisces as per D-7 Narayana dasa, because Pisces represents the 
third child in this D-7. So no changes were made ba sed on the additional 
information. 
 
The gentleman informed this author by personal e-mail later that he was blessed with 
a daughter on November 14. 
 
Real-life Example 3: 
 
Consider the native whose D-10 is given in Chart 90 . He came to this author in May 
1998 and asked if there was a change of job for him . This author checked his D-10 
Narayana dasa. It may be noted that Cp dasa of 10 y ears runs during 1989-1999. 
Antardasa running in March 1998-January 1999 is tha t of Aries. It is the 8 
th  house 
from A10 (which can show the workplace) and its lor d is in the 12 th  from A10. So a 
change of job or turbulence at workplace is possible. 
 

--- Page 505 ---
 Part 6: Real-life Examples 493 
 
  
 
Chart 90 
 
 
Because Ar contains AL and it is a trine from lagna , its antardasa is likely to be good 
for career and status. However, its lord Mars is wi th Rahu in the 8 
th  house from the 
dasa rasi Cp. So this indicates pressures and undes irable developments too. This 
seems to suggest worries at the current job and the n move to a new job with higher 
status. 
 
This can be cross-checked with D-10 of Tajaka annua l chart of 1998-99 (see Chart 
91). AL in D-10 contains its lord Rahu and the othe r lord Saturn is in the 5 
th  house 
from it. These factors suggest good status in caree r in the year. However, Venus 
owns the 7 th  from lagna (dealings with others) and the 9 th  from AL (fortune) and he 
is debilitated. This does suggest some setbacks. Mo reover, Saturn and Sun aspect 
each other in D-10. This shows trouble from authorities. 
 
Let us check Tajaka monthly charts (Chart 92). In T ajaka monthly chart of May 26-
June 26, 1998, lagna lord in D-10 is Venus and he i s in the 12 
th  house with exalted 
Sun, again supporting trouble from authorities. Moon and Mercury are with Ketu and 
Rahu respectively and it does not suggest a happy m ental and emotional state, as far 
as work is concerned. However, in D-10 of the next month’s chart, lagna lord Jupiter 

--- Page 506 ---
  
 
 494 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
is in 10 th  in moolatrikona. Despite other weaknesses, this br ings strength to D-10. In 
rasi chart also, 10 th  lord Mercury is in own rasi Ge (7 th  house) with 9 th  lord Sun and 
this shows good developments in career. 
 
Based on all these factors, it was predicted that t he native’s relationship with his 
managers could deteriorate, he could be frustrated in June, he could be forced out of 
his job and he would join a better job in July. 
 
Chart 91 
 
 
It happened as predicted. At the time of the origin al prediction, this author looked at 
Narayana dasa only upto antardasas. After he knew t hat the prediction came true, he 
checked pratyantardasas (PD) in retrospect. Scorpio ’s PD was running in June. 
Because of the presence of 8 
th  lord and debilitated Moon, its PD brought pressure s 
and frustration.  The conjunction of 8 th  and 12 th  lords can give a Viparita Raja Yoga, 
but that can be effective only when the planets are  in a dusthana in weakness or in a 
quadrant/trine in strength. Here Moon is debilitated and they are in a quadrant.

Chart 92 
 
 

--- Page 508 ---
  
 
 496 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
After the frustration in Sc dasa given by debilitated Moon, next PD of Sg during July 
brought success. He joined a better job. Because Su n is lagna lord and the lord of 5 th  
from AL and because he occupies a trine from AL, th is PD can be good for 
professional status. Because of his rasi aspect on Pi (GL), Sun can give a promotion 
also. Moreover, Sun is the planet of authority. So Sg antardasa gave a new job with a 
higher status. 
 
The native came to this author again in May 1999. H e was planning to buy a house 
in USA and wondered if his career would be stable o r if it would be a mistake to buy 
a house.  
 
Le dasa runs during 1999-2007. Because Le is lagna and the 5 
th  from AL, its dasa 
has to be good. Antardasa of Sg was running till Se pt 1999 and it would be excellent 
for reasons already mentioned. So the native was told that there was nothing to worry 
about and he might in fact have a promotion in the next few months. That came true 
and his position improved at his new company. 
 
Before we close this example, readers may note one thing. Lagna is in Pi, GL is in 
Sg and HL is in Ta in his natal rasi chart. So Venu s owns HL, occupies GL and 
aspects lagna (by rasi aspect). For these reasons, Venus is a yogada (giver of yoga). 
His dasa must be excellent from the point of view o f power as well as money. In rasi 
chart, Venus owns the 8 
th  house and he occupies lagna with Rahu in D-4. Thes e 
factors can suggest that his yoga will be in a fore ign land. Vimsottari dasa of Venus 
started in April 1997 (using 360-day savana years) and the native left India and went 
to USA in April/May 1997. Venus dasa is likely to c ontinue to be good for his career 
and finances. 
 
Real-life Example 4: 
 
On an internet-based Vedic astrology discussion for um, a noted Vedic astrologer of 
west gave the birthdata of her friend’s son, who wa s nominated for an academy 
award (Oscar). The awards were to be announced at a function in Los Angeles on the 
night of March 26, 2000. The lady wanted to know if  her friend’s son would get an 
award or not.

For someone in the entertainment business, an Oscar  nomination itself is a major 
achievement. We cannot look at the dasas one is run ning and conclude whether one 
will win the award or not. Because of the nominatio n, one will get a lot of good 
publicity. If one doesn’t get the award, one may be  unhappy on that night and the 

--- Page 511 ---

next couple of days. We cannot say that one will no t get the award because a bad 
pratyantardasa is running or that one will get the award because a good 
pratyantardasa is running. We need to go much deepe r and look at the 1-2 days 
surrounding the award. We need to understand the na tive’s mood on the morning of 
March 27. That alone can say whether the native won  the award on March 26 or not. 
Irrespective of whether one wins the award or not, a few weeks before March 26 and 
a few months after March 26 are bound to be excelle nt in the native’s career. The 
mood on March 27 is the clinching factor. 
 
Rasi and D-10 of Tajaka monthly chart of March 14-A pril 14, 2000 are given in 
Chart 93. Saturn’s Patyayini dasa runs during March  26-April 3. Saturn is the 6 
th  and 
7th  lord in D-10 and he shows rivals (6 th ) and contacts (7 th ) in the entertainment 
business. His exaltation may show meeting some impo rtant people. However, 
exaltation of 6 th  lord is not favorable. Moreover Saturn is debilita ted in 6 th  in rasi 
chart. That can show disappointments. So meeting wi th important people, getting 
disappointed and making important contacts may be t he results given by Saturn. 
However, we should focus on the 60-hour period for a better idea. 
 
Rasi and D-10 of Tajaka sixty-hour chart of March 2 6-28, 2000 are given in Chart 
94. This chart covers the period that starts in the  afternoon of March 26 and lasts 2.5 
days. In rasi chart, lagna has Rahu in it. Lagna lo rd is debilitated in 5 
th , the house of 
emotions. The strength of the 10 th  house shows a good development in career 
(attending the Oscar night), but the weakness of la gna lord shows a disappointment. 
In D-10, lagna lord is in 8 th  and 8 th  lord is in lagna. 
 
So it was predicted on the forum that the native was unlikely to win the award. Later, 
the lady who gave this chart informed the forum tha t her friend’s son did not win the 
academy award. 
 
Real-life Example 5: 
 
When working on the birthtime rectification of a la dy whose navamsa chart is given 
in Chart 95, this author wanted to guess when her m arriage took place. He first 
looked at Vimsottari dasa. Mercury dasa runs during 1983-1999. Because Mercury is 
the 7 
th  lord in 7 th  in navamsa, his dasa can give marriage. Because Ma rs owns the 2 nd  
house and upapada and joins lagna lord, his antarda sa can give marriage. Jupiter’s 
antardasa can also give marriage.

Chart 95 
 
 
We can cross-check with Kalachakra dasa. Sg dasa ru ns from 1988-1998. For an 
Indian girl, this is the normal age of getting marr ied. So irrespective of planets, this 
must be the dasa of marriage. In any case, Venus oc cupies Sg here and it can give 
marriage. Antardasa can belong to the 7 
th  house Virgo containg Mercury. It can also 
be Gemini owned and aspected by the 7 th  lord. Gemini is the 7 th  house from Venus 
and from dasa rasi. Gemini antardasa runs from Sept 1991 to Aug 1992. 
 
Next, this author checked the Tajaka annual chart o f 1991-92 (see Chart 96). Vivaha 
saham is at 22Ge54, i.e.  in the 7 
th  house. Venus is the significator of marriage and h e 
is at 21Ge11. The situation of Venus in the 7 th  house very close to vivaha saham very 
strongly indicates marriage in the year, perhaps in the Patyayini dasa of Venus. 
 
Mercury is the 7 
th  lord and vivaha saham lord. He is at 13Ar37. Lagna  lord Jupiter is 
at 13Cn52. There is a square aspect between the two  planets. Because Mercury is 
behind Jupiter by one quarter of a degree, there is  a very “poorna (complete) 
ithasala” between them. This also makes marriage extremely likely in the year.

Chart 96 
 
 
In navamsa, Venus owns the 7 
th  house and occupies lagna. Mercury, lord of 7 th  in 
rasi chart, occupies a trine in navamsa and joins navamsa lagna lord. (NOTE : If the 7 th  
lord in rasi chart is well-placed in navamsa, it is  good. The 7 th  lord in rasi shows the 
partner in physical life and navamsa shows inner self and dharma.)

 502 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach  
 
Venus dasa as per annual Patyayini dasa runs from 9
th  Nov 1991 to 7 th  Feb 1992. 
Venus-Mercury antardasa runs during February 5-7, 1 992. So this author asked the 
lady, “did you get married in the first week of Feb ruary 1992?” The lady was not a 
great believer in astrology and she was amazed. She said yes. 
 
At that time, this author did not compute compresse d Narayana dasa, but readers can 
verify that compressed D-9 Narayana dasa of Cn runs  during Feb 5-20, 1992. Her 
marriage took place then and Cn contains upapada in navamsa (see Chart 96). 
 
 
One Last Word 
 
The purpose of these examples is not to brag about some correct predictions. Every 
astrologer makes hundreds or thousands of correct p redictions and possibly hundreds 
of wrong predictions too. I also made many correct predictions and many wrong 
predictions. The purpose of the above examples is t o illustrate the process of making 
predictions and to give guidance to those who are n ew to the process of making 
predictions. 
 
I earnestly hope that readers pursue this divine su bject in the right spirit, master it, 
serve their clients sincerely and contribute to a renaissance in Jyotish. 
 
I again humbly request elders and scholars to correct my mistakes. May I be forgiven 
for my mistakes and excesses. 
 
I bow with gratitude before Lord Jagannatha for mak ing me write this book. May He 
continue to stand in the path of my eyes!
